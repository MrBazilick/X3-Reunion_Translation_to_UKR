 <t id="2172">A Rimes Fact is the manufacturing site for the great bolts of plasticised cloth, called Rimes, that is used by many races in the manufacture of hard wearing work clothes and space suits.(||) The cloth is produced by breaking down the stems of Delexian Wheat into a crude fabric and then mixing it with various Аргон based chemicals, Teladianium, and BoGas to produce the final material.</t>
 <t id="2173">Cloth Rimes</t>
 <t id="2174">Аргон cloth is one of the most versatile items to be found throughout the X Universe. It is traded in great bolts of cloth known as Rimes. Produced by merging the stems of Delexian Wheat with various animal fat based oils it provides the raw materials for hard wearing, and durable clothing, such as work suits, and leisure clothing.(||) The Аргон also use this material for all kinds of packaging. Аргон Cloth is also further proceeded into explosive materials and used in weapon manufacturing.</t>
 <t id="2181">Cahoona Bakery</t>
 <t id="2182">Cahoona Bakeries are huge orbit factories processing Argnu beef into meatsteaks. Armies of robots are needed to maintain the complex process. During more than a dozen stages the raw meat is slowly processed into the food product everybody knows as meatsteaks.(||) It is a nutritious meat based food stuff that, when blended with Boron Spices, makes a diverse range of foods that suit the tastes of most races. The Аргон blend Meatsteaks with Scruffin to create food specifically for the Спліт market in order to expand their trade.</t>
 <t id="2183">Meatsteak Cahoonas</t>

Very important for combat situations.</t>
 <t id="2241">Plankton Farm</t>
 <t id="2242">Despite Boron Plankton being formed naturally on the Boron Home Planet, such is the popularity of Boron Spices that the Boron have established a large number of specialised Plankton farms to meet the demand.(||) These farms are large geodesic domes that create the unique chemical soup that is the atmosphere of Planet Boron. Once produced the Plankton is then transported to a nearby Space Stott Mixery where it is processed into the many different Boron Spices. These factories also add the growing Plankton to Delexian Wheat, Meatsteak Cahoonas and Soja Husk in experiments to produce different varieties of foodstuff.</t>
 <t id="2243">Plankton</t>
 <t id="2244">Boron plankton is found as a scum like surface that floats on the surface of the chemical swamps on Planet Boron. It is produced naturally from certain chemical reactions that are found in the swamp mixing with the ammonia-based air.(||) This scum is collected and then treated with additives and other Boron minerals to produce a wide range of different, and nutritious spices. Since the Boron seas are now completely protected from any industrial usage, Plankton is mainly produced on huge Plankton Space Farms everywhere in the Boron Kingdom.</t>
 <t id="2251">Bio Gas Factory</t>
 <t id="2252">BoGas factories artificially manufacture BoGas, which is only found in its natural state on the Boron home planet. These factories are simple affairs containing chemical mixtures in huge vats where the gas is formed naturally.(||) Large piping systems then drain the gas into decanting areas where it is put into large sealed cylinders for ease of transport. Traditionally these factories were constructed from metal made from ore supplied by the Аргон but throughout the last seventy jazuras the Boron have been refurbishing and re-equipping their BoGas factories using Teladianium.</t>
 <t id="2253">BoGas</t>
 <t id="2254">BoGas. The unusual natural resources found within the planet Boron mean that the planet is really a huge chemical factory. &gt;From these many chemicals the Boron manufacture a unique gas that is used throughout the universe as the ultimate painkiller and anaesthetic.(||) After the Boron government stopped any commercial use of the natural resources of its planet Boron gas is now artificially reproduced in Bio Gas Factories throughout the Boron Kingdom.</t>

 <t id="2313">Singularity Engine Time Accelerator</t>
 <t id="2314">This product is based on the phenomenon of time and space anomaly observed in the presence of singularity. The SETA is an attachment to the ship's normal operational engine, which can, when activated, compress time up to ten fold. Due to the constrains of the space warp it is not possible to alter one's course and velocity due to time compression and the device will be deactivated as soon as any interference to the ship's controls are detected.(||) The invention was clearly made to shorten travel across fast distances. No known side effects exist but they can not be ruled out.</t>
 <t id="2341">Scruffin Farm</t>
 <t id="2342">Scruffin Farms are large agricultural complexes where the Спліт grow vast numbers of Scruffin. The farms are vast geodesic domes that simulate the natural atmosphere and artificial sunlight found on the Спліт home planet. The huge power resources needed to run such a plant are provided by unique Спліт engines that, like their space ship engines, are powered by the use of the Markus Space Fly.(||) This requires that each farm needs large amounts of Nostrop, which they feed to the Marcus Space Fly. In many farms the Спліт are refurbishing their older buildings with new ones manufactured from Teladianium.</t>
 <t id="2343">Scruffin Fruits</t>
 <t id="2344">Scruffin is a large type of edible vegetation similar to sweet potatoes. It is grown by Спліт farmers in large open fields, as well as on gigantic space installations called Scruffin Farms.(||) It is a versatile foodstuff that, when processed, provides a number of Спліт food types. Even though scruffin is traded inside and outside the Спліт territory it is mainly demanded by various Спліт food factories.</t>
 <t id="2351">Chelt Space Aquarium</t>
 <t id="2352">The Chelt Aquariums that are found inside Спліт sectors are vast salt water tanks kept inside geodesic domes where the Спліт farm the creature known as Chelts. These creatures are nourished and then culled to provide the Спліт with meat.(||) The skin of the Chelt is used to make a tough leather, whilst the fatty tissue, after exportation to a Rastar refinery, is rendered down to manufacture the fine oil known as Rastar. Each Aquarium requires Energy and as the Спліт use the Markus Space fly to drive the engines required to control the giant salt-water tanks, they require a constant supply of these poor creatures and Nostrop their food. They also require Teladianium for construction and building, and Soja husk, which is used to feed the young Chelts.</t>
 <t id="2353">Chelts Meat</t>
 <t id="2354">Chelts are natural sea bound animals that once roamed the seas and oceans on the Спліт home planet that the Спліт killed for meat, oil and their skins which they processed to create a tough leather like material. However for many jazuras Chelts were over hunted and almost brought to extinction. Nowadays Chelts are grown in space Chelt Aquariums and are later sold to Спліт food factories.</t>
 <t id="2371">Massom Mill</t>
 <t id="2372">Massom Mills are Спліт controlled food processing factories that convert Scruffin, the basic Спліт foodstuff, into a yellow powder called Massom that is used by many races to mix with and enhance their own foods.(||) The Спліт are also adding Scruffin to Soja husk, which produces a different flavoured Massom powder, which is preferred by the Паранід race. Massom Mills are powered by engines driven by the Markus Space fly that require amounts of Nostrop.</t>
 <t id="2373">Massom powder</t>
 <t id="2374">Massom is a powdered form of Scruffin. It is a basic yellow powder produced by the Спліт from the Scruffin, a sweet potato like food grown by the Спліт.(||) This powder is traded by other races that use it to mix and enhance their own foodstuff. It is manufactured in Massom Mills found everywhere in the Спліт territory and sold in large, one tonne bulk containers.</t>
 <t id="2381">Rastar Refinery</t>
 <t id="2382">A Rastar Refinery is a dark and evil smelling place where large chunks of the fatty flesh of the Chelt are rendered down, and then processed to produce a fine oil called Rastar.(||) Many races use this oil as lubrication for delicate mechanical parts. In addition to its other resources each factory also requires large numbers of Space flies and their food Nostrop.</t>
 <t id="2383">Rastar Oil</t>
 <t id="2384">Rastar is an oil produced from the animal fat of the Chelt, a farmed sea bound animal on Спліт.(||) This oil, once refined, is very fine and is used by most races to lubricate engines and other moving mechanical parts.

 <t id="2393">Spaceflies</t>
 <t id="2394">This creature is a small unintelligent space fly that lives in the vast emptiness of deep space. They are the size of a small bird and seem to be made out of delicate shinning gossamer that reacts to light and shimmers and shines in a multitude of colours.(||) The Markus live in vast complex hives hollowed out of asteroids and perform a valuable function by collecting space junk and other debris, which they capture and take back to their asteroids to be used in the construction of their hives. They travel together in great swarms and communicate with a series of musical notes, similar to bird song, that echo inside space. Their beauty, and the beauty of their music, is famed throughout the X Universe and all intelligent space races delight in seeing them. Pilots will stop to watch a swarm fly past. Creatures working on the outside of ships and space stations have claimed that the Markus will fly near them and even perch on them, singing all the while. However throughout space sightings of The Markus Space Fly are becoming very rare. This is manly due to the actions of The Спліт, who capture and use the small space fly to power their spaceships. Currently the Foundation Guild are pressing for the Markus to be made a protected species and pressure is being put on the Спліт to change their system of powering their space ship engines. It is believed that, despite a universal ban on their capture or trading, some Пірат still hunt and capture this creature in order to sell then to the Спліт.</t>

 <t id="2443">Soja Beans</t>
 <t id="2444">Soja beans grow naturally inside large caves found throughout the Паранід home planet. As they grow in the dark they are white in colour and retain a large amount of moisture. The Паранід farm them and gently squeeze out this moisture, which they then use as a source of water. The dry beans are then mashed, and processed to produce a type of basic foodstuff used as the base for many of the Паранід different food types.(||) It is traded as Soja husk. The space installations growing these beans are also called Soy farms.</t>
 <t id="2451">Snail Ranch</t>
 <t id="2452">In order to meet the increasing demand for Majaglit the Паранід have created a number of specialised snail farms dedicated to the breeding and farming of the Maja Snail.(||) Inside these farms great artificial pools and rivers have been constructed to create an artificial environment where Maja Snails breed easily</t>

 <t id="3101">Federal Аргон Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3102">{17,3108} {17,3109}</t>
 <t id="3108">(General description for all shipyards)Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. They are factories of gigantic dimension, built to manufacture all the space vehicles and even build and sell whole construction kits for new factories. Because of the immense resources and labour required to build as well as run a factory like this, shipyards are rare to encounter.</t>
 <t id="3109">Аргон shipyards are large, automated industrial plants, dedicated to the construction of the entire range of Аргон space ships. In addition to the valuable raw materials and technology, these factories also contain experimental areas where new designs and ship improvements are always being developed and tested, and as a result are heavily guarded. Therefore all Аргон shipyards should be approached with great caution.</t>
 <t id="3112">The Аргон Colossus is the Carrier Class of the Аргон. In its working lifespan, this ship has seen many changes. It is heavily armed with 6 cannons and replaces the previous class, which was originally built in response to rumours of a Ксенон super ship uncovered by the Аргон Secret Service. Because of its success, the Аргон built many ships of this new class. As new technologies have been developed, these ships have undergone several major refits in recent jazuras. The flagship of the Аргон carrier fleet is the Аргон One stationed in Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="3122">Up to the building of Аргон One, the Titan was the biggest ship in the Аргон fleet. It is a destroyer class battleship armed with 18 lasers. Although heavy and difficult to manoeuvre, in the hands of a capable Аргон Captain, this ship is a powerful weapon with a noble heritage.(||) Its predecessors fought and won many major battles in both the Ксенон Conflict and Boron Campaign. Since then the ship has been regularly updated and redesigned, but is still basically the same ship.</t>
 <t id="3142">The Аргон Buster was once the pride of the Аргон fleet and was instrumental in gaining the Аргон victory in the Ксенон Conflict. However during the Boron campaign it was superseded by the Аргон Elite.(||) Over the intervening jazuras the design of the Аргон Buster has been modified and new, more powerful engines have been fitted. Now updated, and armed with two lasers, the Buster is the number two fighter ship of the Аргон Fighter Command.</t>
 <t id="3152">The Аргон Discoverer compared to other ships in the Аргон Fleet, is relatively young. It is armed with two lasers, is light, versatile, and very manoeuvrable.(||) It is the preferred training fighter for Аргон pilots with the more experienced being promoted to fly the more exacting Buster and the Nova. Today they are also used for scouting, and it is quite common to find a small wing of these ships accompanying an exploration carrier.</t>
 <t id="3162">The Аргон Mammoth is a Heavy Transporter ship, usually found in Аргон Federation territory. It is so large that it cannot dock at any space station, instead it is loaded and unloaded by docking some distance from the station, having its freight ferried backwards and forwards by fleets of smaller transporters.(||) These ships are owned by successful private entrepreneur pilots who have made a great investment in order to purchase them - therefore they are more than keen to hire out their services.</t>
 <t id="3181">Free Аргон Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3182">Typical Аргон Space station used throughout entire Аргон federation territory. Developed by Аргон over many jazuras these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas, and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres. Each space station is under jurisdiction of The Аргон Federation and is governed by an elected senator. He represents the station in the main Аргон Parliament. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
 <t id="3191">Аргон Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3192">Аргон Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Аргон territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3201">Royal Boron Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3202">{17,3108} {17,3209}</t>
 <t id="3209">The Boron shipyard is a hive of activity, mainly due to the fact that the Boron do not believe in a lot of automation, instead preferring to trust the fine skills and talents of their many engineers, craftsmen, and semi skilled workers. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, and they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="3212">The Boron Shark is a fast carrier class battleship and replaces the much older and outdated Boron Cuttlefish. It is believed that this new ship was designed and constructed in light of the rumours of the Ксенон BMS and, together with the Аргон One, presents a formidable opposition to any enemy.(||) It is well known that Аргон technology was traded with the Boron to enable them to produce such a ship and that the two ships were designed to compliment each other.</t>
 <t id="3222">This Boron destroyer is fast, manoeuvrable and, despite the Borons peaceful nature, very deadly. It is heavily armed, and its weapons are complemented with powerful shield generators.(||) Its design and technology was revolutionary, as most of the older Boron designs were scrapped and remade after the Boron Conflict. It is manned by the highly trained pilots of the Boron Space Fleet.</t>
 <t id="3252">The Octopus was developed to be the Boron version of the Discoverer.(||) Its design was revolutionary and all races, when it was first seen, were very keen to know how effective it was. The success of the Octopus sent ripples throughout the Boron sectors as more was produced, but today it is considered to be obsolete, although it is still in service.</t>
 <t id="3262">The Boron Orca is a heavy-duty transporter craft, fractionally bigger than the Аргон Mammoth. It cannot dock directly at a space station and has to rely on a relay of smaller ships to ferry cargo backwards and forwards to it.(||) Despite looking cumbersome the Orca is manoeuvrable and is slightly faster than Аргон Mammoth. Many of these ships are privately owned and it is possible to hire them - for a price.</t>
 <t id="3272">The Boron Dolphin is a cost effective transporter ship. Its unique Boron technology has been developed and combined with Аргон know-how to produce a transporter that can carry great loads whilst moving gracefully.(||) It can be found in most Boron sectors.</t>
 <t id="3281">Royal Boron Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3282">The Space Stations of the Boron are not comfortable due to heavy ammonia content of their atmosphere. Despite that many different races frequently use them as the Boron are not only members of the Foundation Guild but also benefit from established trade agreements with Теладі and Паранід.(||) Each space station is governed by an Imperial Captain selected by the Boron government and whose position is verified by the Boron Royal Family.</t>

 <t id="3301">Спліт Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3302">{17,3108} {17,3309}</t>
 <t id="3309">At first the shipyards belonging to the Спліт seem to look like prison camps. That is not far from the truth as the ruling Спліт council commit all their criminals to serve time labouring inside the shipyards.(||) The Спліт shipyards are heavily guarded and it is very rare for a member of any race to get close enough to them to make a full report before getting shot down.</t>
 <t id="3312">The Raptor is the Спліт carrier ship. It first made an appearance in the war against the Boron when it proved to be effective but vulnerable to attack from beneath. It is believed that, over the intervening jazuras, the Спліт have re-developed the ship to eliminate this problem.(||) A High-ranking Спліт officer who is linked by kin to the ruling family clan commands the ship. Generally they are even more abrasive and arrogant than the other members of their race.</t>
 <t id="3322">The Python is the one of the most effective destroyer ships in Спліт Sectors. It is well armed, and lethal. It is also one of the most aggressive ships in the universe, its captains all being briefed to fire first and ask questions later.(||) There are rumours of a second, more powerful, class of destroyer that was used during a Спліт family feud, but it is thought that these ships no longer exist as the Python is still being produced.</t>
 <t id="3332">A long serving and deadly fighter developed by the Спліт Military. It has been only in recent jazuras that this ship has been made public.(||) The current Спліт Patriarch has a small fleet of these ships that act as escort ships that accompany the primary destroyer of the fleet. In the hands of an experienced pilot, this ship can survive the darkest of battles, because of the ships high speed he can avoid most of laserbeams and missiles.</t>
 <t id="3342">A forerunner of this ship fought in the Boron Campaign and proved to be a very powerful opponent. Like most of the other Спліт ships, this new design was more based on high speed engines and big weapon power, as in great shield strengths.(||) Over the jazuras this ship had been totally up-dated and rearmed.</t>
 <t id="3362">This huge Transporter is too large to dock in any space station and carries a number of smaller freighters to load and unload its trading goods.(||) It is believed that this Transporter is an evolutionary form of a much smaller Transporter called the Rhino, which seems to have been phased out over the last hundred jazuras. It is believed that a different Спліт family clan controls each Transporter.</t>
 <t id="3381">Спліт Trading Port</t>
 <t id="3382">The Спліт Space Stations are dark and unfriendly places. Visiting trading races are tolerated but not encouraged to stay longer than necessary and are not allowed inside the inner structure.(||) Few members of the Аргон race ever venture near enough to them for more detailed information to be compiled. It is believed that many of them are owned by the various ruling family clans.</t>

 <t id="3402">{17,3108} {17,3409}</t>
 <t id="3409">The Паранід build their spaceships in large automated assembly plants. In these factories they forge their own metals and plastics, design and develop new ships, as well as constructing and testing the entire range of Паранід space ships.</t>
 <t id="3412">The Zeus is the primary carrier in the Паранід Fleet. Information about this ship other than the fact that it as very deadly as result of new weapon technologies, are not released.(||) This ships tactics are not to get close to battle, and to release its swarm of powerful fighters from a distance. Паранід pilots have been known to hide their ships in dense asteroid fields to keep their signature from hostile craft.</t>
 <t id="3422">This destroyer is the pride of the Паранід Fleet. It was developed from an earlier model used by the Паранід in their alliance with the Спліт in the Boron Campaign.(||) It is believed that this ship was last updated during the threat of conflict between the Паранід and the Спліт.</t>
 <t id="3452">This ship is the main fighter craft of the Паранід race, and the most common. It has a good speed and is armed with two front mounted laser.(||) Constantly being updated, this ship also dates back to the earlier period of the Паранід Спліт war against the Boron.</t>
 <t id="3462">This ship is the largest transporter in the Паранід Fleet. It is too big to dock at space stations and employs a fleet of shuttlecraft to load and unload its cargo.(||) It is commanded by a lesser Priest Baron, who is directly under the command of its original space station Priest Duke commander. It is believed that many of these ships can be hired for certain commissions - however those conditions do not apply to members of the Аргон race.</t>
 <t id="3472">This ship is the most common of the Паранід transporter ships. It travels great distances, carrying many different goods.(||) Due to the complex hierarchical structure of the Паранід race it is commanded by a lesser Priest Lord under the command of its home space station Priest Duke.</t>
 <t id="3481">Паранід Trading Dock</t>
 <t id="3482">This space station is highly developed and features the latest Паранід technology, however due to their secretive nature, very few people are allowed inside its inner body.(||) Паранід space stations trade mainly with Теладі, Спліт and Boron. Members of Аргон race are allowed to trade but, due to the ongoing animosity between the two races, trade is the only contact the two races have. A Priest Duke commands each space station. It is however believed that each station contains a Паранід temple, access as usual is strictly restricted to Паранід Monks.</t>
 <t id="3491">Паранід Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3492">Паранід Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Паранід territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3501">Теладі Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3502">{17,3108} {17,3509}</t>
 <t id="3509">The shipyards of the Теладі could never be described as hi-tech. Indeed these large factories are packed with a strange assortment of low-tech equipment supplied by many different races, and cobbled together to create a makeshift work area.(||) Long ago the Теладі, ever aware of the need to make profit, decided the most economic way to build space craft was to get someone else to do it for them. They buy ships from other races that are either old, damaged, or just past their sell-by-date which they dismantle, and cannibalise, using the parts and equipment to make ships better suited to their own requirements.</t>
 <t id="3512">The Condor is the carrier ship of the Теладі Company Space Fleet. It is a powerful battleship based upon technology supplied by the Спліт combined with that of the older Аргон Prime VI.(||) Rarely seen outside Теладі sectors the ship is slow but heavily armed and shielded compared to the carriers of other races, its Captains preferring to last longer than others in a battle while still avoiding to get into trouble in the first place.</t>
 <t id="3522">The Phoenix is the destroyer ship operated by the Теладі Company Space Fleet. Its technology is based upon the Паранід Odysseus and the Boron Ray. It is well armed and shielded but rarely known to fight.</t>
 <t id="3532">The Теладі Falcon fighter is a hybrid between the old Аргон Elite and the Boron Piranha, with some Спліт technology thrown in for good measure. It is fast, well armed and can be found operating in most sectors.(||) It is suspected that some of these ships have been leased by the Теладі Company Space Fleet to operate on behalf of the Пірат, although to date no actual proof of this agreement can be established.</t>
 <t id="3562">This huge transporter is too large for any space station and carries its own fleet of smaller transporter ships which load and unload its cargo.(||) It is one of the best shielded large transporter ships, a testimony to the Теладі trait of preferring to last long enough until help arrives. Its basic design and technology is a hybrid between an older version of the Аргон Mammoth and the Паранід Hercules.</t>
 <t id="3572">The Vulture is the trading vessel commonly used by the Теладі in all space sectors and can always be found wherever the largest profit is to be made, no matter in whose sector it happens to be.(||) It is also believed that a number of these transporters have been supplied to the Пірат that operate throughout Теладі sectors in exchange for Невідомий preferential trading services.</t>
 <t id="3581">Теладі Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3582">Теладі space stations are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built for trading purposes.(||) They are not popular places due to the Теладі belief in profit. On each space station everything has a price, and one that is generally higher than other races. Much of the hi-tech equipment on board the station has been bought or traded from other races and so the station inside appears to be a strange hybrid mixture of the various race technologies. Each station is controlled by a citizen who sits on the Теладі governing board.</t>
 <t id="3591">Теладі Space Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3592">Теладі Space Equipment Docks are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3612">The Carrier ship of the Ксенон is a slow yet powerful beast. Armed with Several cannons and fighters stored in its large hangar bay, the Ксенон J is considered a moderate threat.(||) Most ships are able to escape an attack from a J class ship because of its speed. But these ships are usually accompanied by several Destroyer vessels.</t>
 <t id="3622">This destroyer was one of the most powerful ships the Аргон faced in the Ксенон Conflict and its memory still deserves the greatest of respect.(||) It had formidable firepower and a great defensive capability. The Ксенон in the last decade have updated this class of ship. This ship should still be considered as a major threat, although they hardly ever leave their own systems.</t>
 <t id="3632">The L is the most powerful Ксенон fighter developed; it is armed with multiple lasers, and powerful shields.(||) These ships are often seen attacking passing ships trying to take shortcuts through their sectors. Like the other Ксенон ships, the L has been updated in the last few jazuras.</t>
 <t id="3642">The Ксенон M is a fighter craft that first fought in the Ксенон Conflict. It was fast and lethal.(||) Its pilots showed no sign of fear. Indeed many of these ships were used as kamikaze craft, deliberately being crashed into Аргон carriers and destroyers.</t>
 <t id="3652">The N is considered to be a short-range scout ship of the Ксенон, it is only lightly armed but very fast.(||) A forerunner of this ship fought in the Ксенон conflict, but its participation was not considered to be great.</t>
 <t id="3662">The Ксенон I is the largest freighter used by the Ксенон to set up their stations.(||) Like its smaller counterpart, this ship is rarely seen, but it has been known to replace stations destroyed by Attackers. It also is usually accompanied by a group of fighters and sometimes a Ксенон K.</t>
 <t id="3671">Ксенон H</t>
 <t id="3672">The Ксенон H is the smaller freighter used by the Ксенон, this ship has not changed much and is very rare to see.(||) Several fighters usually accompany it. But be warned, as this freighter is capable of carrying heavy weaponry.</t>
 <t id="3681">Ксенон Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3682">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. And all the sentient races have at least one. The Ксенон shipyard is of different construct to the other races, and not much is known about it.(||) What is known is that all the Ксенон ships are constructed here, from the basic Ксенон N to the large Ксенон J Carrier ships. And it is also believed that the Ксенон Mothership was also constructed here. Like most Ксенон installations, it is heavily guarded by a destroyer group. Which is why this station hasn't been destroyed to prevent Ксенон attacks.</t>
 <t id="3691">Ксенон Station</t>
 <t id="3692">This station has been in use since the Ксенон Conflict, it is a simple construct of modules that rotates to generate gravity by using pulses of rotational thrusters.(||) It is unclear what happens on Ксенон Bases, but these stations are located in most Ксенон Sectors. What is clear is that these stations house many ships, from fighters to freighters and are heavily guarded. Approach with caution.</t>
 <t id="3699">The illustrations used are developed from what little knowledge exists to the Аргон Secret Service combined with some expert guess work based upon experience gained during the Ксенон Conflict. It could well be that many of the Ксенон ships have changed shape or that their designs have been updated. It has been assumed that their technology has advanced over the years in a similar way to the other races of the Universe.</t>

 <t id="3762">A pirate base with a difference, this station is much larger and more heavily protected than a standard pirate base, any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters.(||) Unlike its counterpart this station is built using a captured base that existed in this sector before it was seized by a pirate force. This stations trade port and cargo facilities are large, and stocks everything from shields and high-tech weaponry, though to Space weed and Cahoona Meatsteaks. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the Пірат this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation. All manner of pleasures are to be found inside - most of them either highly immoral or highly illegal.</t>
 <t id="3771">Pirate Ship</t>
 <t id="3772">The Пірат often use transporters supplied by the Теладі, but they also use a wide variety of transporter ships that have been captured, stolen or in some cases traded from most races. All of them are armed.(||) These ships are very difficult to spot being heavily camouflaged. They tend to slip through space without being noticed. Even if they are seen they are very difficult to approach as most of them are engaged in highly illegal operations.</t>
 <t id="3781">Pirate Base</t>
 <t id="3782">Despite the Пірат calling their base a space station this pirate base is actually constructed from the hulks of old transporter ships. It is heavily camouflaged and is very difficult to locate and see.(||) It is also rumoured that if the base is in danger of attack, or discovery, it is simply flown to a new secret location. It is also well guarded and any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons, and to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters. Once accepted at the station a pilot may trade anything and everything. No cargo is too dangerous, no price is too high for the right goods. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the Пірат this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation. All manner of pleasures are to be found inside - most of them either highly immoral or highly illegal.</t>
 <t id="3791">Data Storage Device</t>
 <t id="3792">This is a data storage device. It can store audio and video data.</t>
 <t id="3812">This ship is considered to be a valuable asset to the Пірат, as they cannot buy ships from any of the races, except ships supplied by the Теладі. It can use a variety of weapons and missiles.(||) It can usually defend itself against similar opponents, and has a fair amount of cargo space. Most of the time it is escorted by Pirate Bayamons and Pirate Mandalays.</t>
 <t id="3822">This fast and powerful ship offers the most versatility for Пірат. It is among the fastest ships in its class of all known races. Its speed, mobility and the 4 weapon mounts make this ship deadly, its effectiveness should never be underestimated.</t>
 <t id="3832">The Pirate Mandalay is the fastest of the Pirate ships. The Mandalay is the backbone for express transfers of cargo and also as an auxiliary escort to the Orinoco in conjunction with the Bayamon.</t>

 <t id="3911">SQUASH Mine Factory</t>
 <t id="3912">This factory produces the SQUASH mine, a small explosive device developed to blockade stations, trading routes and gates.(||) Although these devices can be handy to use against military targets, they are considered highly illegal by some races who have witnessed some of these weapons accidentally destroy merchant and civilian ships as they do not have friend or foe recognition.</t>
 <t id="3913">SQUASH Mine</t>
 <t id="3914">A very destructive mine. Typically used to protect important strategic locations. Beware: This mine does not have a friend foe recognition!</t>
 <t id="3921">Lasertower Factory</t>
 <t id="3922">This factory produces laser towers, developed to become the ultimate defence for all stations. With a powerful laser that only fits into laser towers these weapons are considered to be substantially advanced in comparison to previous forms of weaponry.(||) Laser towers have started to appear in all corners of known space as all races see just how useful these defences can be against small groups of raiders. The artificial intelligence on board these towers allow for them to identify when the station it is protecting comes under attack, it can then adjust its friend or foe system accordingly.</t>
 <t id="3923">Lasertower</t>
 <t id="3924">A defence installation typically found around stations or factories to help them against invaders.</t>
 <t id="3931">Drone Factory</t>
 <t id="3932">This production facility manufactures the fighter drone, a small autonomous device that when given orders will attack using its single laser weapon.(||) They are produced using the best in computer technology, artificial intelligence and laser weaponry. Pilots use these small drones not to cause considerable damage to an enemy ship, but to cause numerous distractions when being attacked. If used in numbers, fighter drones can be effective.</t>
 <t id="3933">Fighter Drone</t>

 <t id="3964">This extension allows a ship to steer sidewise without turning, making some advanced steering manoeuvres possible.</t>
 <t id="3973">Transporter Device</t>
 <t id="3974">The transporter device is a development based on the remains of the jump drive first introduced with the Xperimental ship and reverse engineered by the best scientists of all races. Using this device you can get from one ship into another ship within a range of 5km without using your spacesuit.</t>
 <t id="3983">Jumpdrive</t>
 <t id="3984">The jump drive is a new development. This ultimate upgrade allows your ship to jump to far distant sectors immediately. To focus on a distant jump gate through many different sectors and through many other gates, it requires additional energy containers for every sector it has to cross.</t>

 <t id="4012">When the first system was attacked this was one of the two heavy ships observed. It is armed with 6 weapons that are visible. There have been reports of smaller class ships docking to this ship. Its function would lead us to believe that it is equivalent with a Carrier class ship, but nothing else is known at present.(||) Upon a close scan, it appeared to have a large cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="4022">This ship is extremely dangerous. Keeping your distance would be advised. A scout recorded a count of at least 18 weapons, 3 mounted on 6 turrets. It has not been confirmed yet if this is true. This ship also was present at the first encounter of which single-handedly destroyed two stations. It is approximately the equivalent of a Destroyer class ship.</t>
 <t id="4032">This ship first appeared in an assault party. It is the heaviest fighter class ship of this race. It is speculated that it is equivalent to an M3 class.(||) No pilots have yet survived to relay more information from a battlefield. It is rumoured that some ships though have been captured and are being investigated to extract alien technology</t>
 <t id="4042">This ship was first seen on a skirmish that took place recently. It is equivalent to an M4 class ship.(||) Shields and weaponry are Невідомий. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4052">This ship was the first that was encountered of this species. It is considered to be a Scout ship due to its speed and armament.(||) It is very agile and its flying observed in a group formation suggests that they are some type of insectoid or based on a Hive like behaviour and being controlled from one point. This theory has yet to be verified due to limited contact. Not much else is known about this ship</t>
 <t id="4062">This ship first appeared in an assault party. The ship is made up of an M3 Fighter and several smaller M5 Scout craft.(||) One theory is that the gateless jump drive this species operates needs multiple power generators to form a stable wormhole that allows for the jump into known territories, where they then Спліт to form a wing of fighters. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4082">The function of this alien station is not yet determined.(||) Even when scanned at close range by a cover operation, revealed inconsistent data and interference. Even under further analysis, nothing was able to be determined about its function.</t>
 <t id="4112">The Centaur is a new development from Аргон Shipwrights in Омікрон Ліри, the ship itself is larger than a Fighter or Small Transporter, but is much smaller than a Destroyer.(||) Centaur is a new breed of corvette Class craft, capable of carrying one M5 class ship. Armed with turrets capable of supporting heavy weaponry, faster than a Nova and with over 3 times the shield strength, this ship has a bright future ahead of it.</t>
 <t id="4132">When the long serving Аргон Elite was retired four jazuras ago, the Аргон military was left without an M3 fighter, that was until a group of Shipwrights in Омікрон Ліри put forward plans for a new type of ship. The Nova was born shortly afterwards, and after two jazuras of testing virtually all of the older Elite class ship have been replaced by this new craft.(||) Capable of holding powerful weaponry, and armed with an aft turret, the Nova is bound to serve the Аргон military for many jazuras to come.</t>
 <t id="4162">The purpose of the Express is to act as a passenger transporter for civilians wanting to travel between systems and stations.(||) This was always a problem as passengers travelled in converted Lifter class freighters. But when the lifter was retired from service, it was found the Mercury could not replace the job of transporting people. The Express was constructed by a group of Civilians at Аргон Prime out of old planetary transport hulls to transport its workers from one station to another in one go. The Аргон Shipyard saw the ship and became interested in its design, which was altered slightly to act as the newest passenger transport ship.</t>
 <t id="4172">Mercury is the latest addition to the Аргон Merchant Fleet, and it is a worthy successor to the Аргон Lifter. Armed with an aft turret for defensive purposes, and increased shield space, the Mercury is more than capable of defending itself.(||) Аргон shipwrights that developed this craft were more than proud when the first ship rolled off the production line at Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="4181">Federal Аргон Wharf</t>
 <t id="4182">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. The older version of the shipyards were brought back into service when the Аргон Shipyards became overworked building more, larger ships and new station classes. Wharfs are built to handle the construction of smaller ships, freighters, and corvettes.(||) It is also known that the Аргон Wharf is a hub of research and trade activity, when ships of other races are sold here, they are dismantled and researched, or sold back to the race to whom they belong. All Аргон Wharfs are heavily guarded by Аргон fighter patrols.</t>
 <t id="4212">The Boron Hydra is a new class of ship, corvettes were developed to give extra protection to large fleets of Transport craft, and to destroy any incoming missiles while the fighters dealt with the attacking vessels, a job that they still keep to this day as they are fast enough to keep up with a convoy.(||) It is also capable of holding one M5 class ship that can be used for various tasks.</t>
 <t id="4232">The Barracuda is a new development to replace the Eel. When the plans for the Barracuda were developed, it was made clear that the Eel was too out-dated. The Barracuda improved on the design with a new power generator. This then allowed for the weaponry to be upgraded and room for slightly increased cargo space and improved acceleration.(||) As the Barracuda is now in service the Eel is no longer supported by the Boron Navy.</t>
 <t id="4242">A Major design flaw in the Piranha, lead to it being decommissioned from service. After being left without a light fighter class, the Boron Navy commissioned the Mako, it has enlarged cargo space and speed when compared to the Piranha, but has similar weapon capacities.(||) The design is loosely based on that of the Barracuda, as it is the same team of designers who constructed both ships.</t>
 <t id="4262">The Manta used to be used for royal service only, transporting important personnel from one sector to another. But now the ship has been downgraded to carry Passengers between systems.(||) The ship itself is large enough to carry many people, equipped with state of the art entertainment systems and comfortable seating to give the passengers a safe journey. It is also able to carry a certain amount to laser weaponry for defence.</t>
 <t id="4281">Royal Boron Dry-dock</t>
 <t id="4282">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies, and the Boron dry-dock does not stray from this simple description. They build smaller craft so that the larger shipyards can handle the building of Stations and larger battleships and transporters.(||) Most smaller Boron Ships are born here when the local research and development team test their ships. Boron high standards mean that only 1 in 30 ships designed, are put into full service. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="4312">The Dragon is the new designed Corvette class ship of the Спліт, which had some problems during the test phase of the prototype. It is a very fast ship, with great weapon power.(||)The Dragon entered service a decade ago, only to be taken out again when the prototype ship exploded as it docked to a shipyard in Сімейна Гордість, destroying the structure and killing 500 people who were on board at the time. The Спліт spent a further 3 jazuras trying to find out why the ship exploded. A small fracture in the reactor was to blame, and when the reactor casing was re-designed the ship re-entered service, although many Спліт pilots consider the ship a curse.</t>
 <t id="4352">This ship is the successful replacement to the ageing Wolf that was in service since the Спліт first started to construct ships. The Jaguar is capable of increased speed and increased firepower to the expense of cargo space.(||) This ship is primarily used as a scout craft, due to its speed, mainly as it is unable to do anything more.</t>
 <t id="4362">This fast transport ship has been in service for many jazuras now. The ship was originally intended to be a Slave transport craft, which transported slaves from where they were captured to the factories where they would spend the rest of their tazuras.(||) Now the ship is used to transport personnel from sector to sector. It is armed with adequate weaponry, but its main defence is speed.</t>
 <t id="4372">The prototype replacement to the Mule, was nearly destroyed in the Dragon Incident, but it managed to save 100 people that were nearly killed as the docking crew tried to escape. The Caiman Project was continued in Поразка Чо where it was eventually finished, and put into service taking supplies to rebuild the Shipyard in Сімейна Гордість.(||) The ship is armed with a single turret and slightly faster than its predecessor.</t>
 <t id="4381">Спліт Dockyard</t>
 <t id="4382">An original Паранід Hard Labour Camp, designed to hold prisoners and to force them to build small craft for the Паранід Empire. This was to change when the Паранід built large Shipyards. After the Dragon Incident, it was decided to bring back these smaller independent shipyards for constructing smaller craft, where they could be tested and modified.(||) If an accident does occur again, the Спліт will have a separate station to fall on when they need to rebuild. You can usually find small craft, transporters and corvettes here, but not all ships can be found at every Dockyard.</t>
 <t id="4412">The Nemesis is the newest battleship to enter the Паранід Army; the ship is a small craft with the firepower of near to the level of a Carrier. Its defence consists of 2 Shield Slots, and capable of carrying Hornet Missiles. Its speed is to the equivalent of Fighters, which makes it capable of acting as a Bomber or as an Escort Ship.(||) It is capable of carrying one M5 craft, which can act as a transport or backup craft, as the nemesis can not dock with most stations.</t>
 <t id="4442">The Pericles was developed to replace the aging Poseidon. The Pericles improved on the earlier model by increasing shield capacity and the speed of the ship, while keeping the weapon compatibility.(||) The Pericles spent a long time in development as it had some structural flaws. These flaws were ironed out and the ship entered service to the sadness of the pilots who had become used to the sight of the Poseidon.</t>
 <t id="4462">The Hermes is based on an old original design for the Ganymede, but the design was re-worked to accommodate passengers. Like most Паранід ships it is able to hold a certain amount of weaponry, primarily for defence.(||) It is very unlikely you will see this ship in Аргон Systems, mainly as the tension between the two neighbours remains high.</t>
 <t id="4472">The Demeter has been used for some jazuras now, replacing the old Паранід Ganymede model, improving on all of its predecessors systems.(||) This ship was first brought into service to serve only the Паранід Fleet, but later slowly replaced the Ganymede because of their speed to bring the Паранід Economy back to levels of the Аргон and Boron.</t>
 <t id="4481">Паранід Pier</t>
 <t id="4482">The Паранід Pier is a small station built separate to a larger shipyard, unlike most other races these stations do not build the craft, but add the components to them before being sold, this is due to the construction process by the Паранід, the hulls of ships are built at the main shipyard then transported to the Pier where the rest of the ship is built.(||) This was done when docking at the original shipyards had a maximum of 6 stazuras wait to dock. This meant Паранід expansion into new territories took a long time. The Pier was designed and built within three mazuras from a spare equipment dock to handle the traffic of traders.</t>
 <t id="4512">The Osprey is a muddle of Аргон and original Теладі Technology, it was developed to become a long-range cargo transport craft, as it fits similar amounts of cargo to the Теладі Vulture.(||) The ship itself combines Shield and Weapon Compatibility to be one of the most deadly Теладі Craft currently in service. But its speed makes it one of the slowest craft of its class.</t>
 <t id="4542">The Buzzard was developed to replace the Теладі's most successful fighter; the Hawk. Buzzard improves on virtually everything about the ship. The main feature of the ship is the third shield slot and much improved acceleration.(||) Although the hawk was the pride of the Теладі Fighter Fleet, the Buzzard may just replace its good reputation.</t>
 <t id="4552">The Теладі Bat was considered to be the slowest M5 of its class, so it was retired and the Теладі Harrier replaced the ship. It is considered to be more profitable out of the two, although it has not improved on its speed very much.(||) As the Теладі Believe in profit the ships cargo bay has been extended to fit double the original capacity at the expense of shield space.</t>
 <t id="4562">The Toucan is a mid-range luxury passenger transport craft. Equipped with the necessary entertainment facilities to keep its passengers comfortable in its journey, from computerised gambling to up to the date visual entertainment, all in the confines of a luxury seat.(||) The ship itself can be armed, but lacks speed; it is known that this ship is the slowest of its class.</t>
 <t id="4581">Теладі Showroom</t>
 <t id="4582">The Теладі Showroom is exactly what it sounds like; small ships are transported here to be sold in luxurious surroundings.(||) Unlike other Теладі stations, Showrooms allow the buyer to view a ship before purchase; this was done when it was found that Теладі Ship Sales are only at 8% when all races sales are put together. After the Теладі opened up on their ships, the sales jumped higher. These stations were first placed in key Теладі Sectors, but soon expanded to other primary sectors. But buyers beware; the Теладі will try everything to get your money.</t>
 <t id="4621">Ion Disruptor Forge</t>
 <t id="4622">This forge manufactures the weapon known as the Ion Disruptor. This new weapon is considered to be more useful than powerful.(||) Manufacturing the weapon is a different matter, it is a complicated process, which involves creating a device able to create a stream of ionised particles. This itself is dangerous.</t>
 <t id="4623">Ion Disruptor</t>
 <t id="4624">This weapon is unlike any weapon encountered, developed by Boron Scientists, this weapon fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. Then the stream is ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, while leaving the hull relatively untouched.(||) Although this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps up to Boron standards.</t>
 <t id="4631">Mobile Drilling System Factory</t>
 <t id="4632">This factory manufactures the Mobile Drilling System which is used to break up ore-rich asteroids into smaller pieces without the need for a stationary mining facility.</t>
 <t id="4633">Mobile Drilling System</t>
 <t id="4634">The Mobile Drilling System accelerates and emits small fast rotating helical particles which drill into rock and use supersonic resonance to break up the rock. Its effectiveness against other materials is very low.</t>

 <t id="4731">Xperimental Shuttle</t>
 <t id="4732">Not much is known about the ship known as the Xperimental Shuttle. This ship was supposed to be able to cross vast distances without having to use jump gates, by generating its own wormhole. Аргон Scientists are still trying to fix the ship and get its drive back into working order.(||) When the ship was built it was considered to be the fastest ship of its class. It also attracted the attention of people when it landed on stations, as this ship is unique.</t>
 <t id="4741">Space Suit</t>
 <t id="4742">This technologically advanced space suit keeps the wearer warm, shields from radiation and offers some manoeuvrability, but gives little protection against laser weapons.</t>
 <t id="4752">The Гонер ship is the only ship known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the goners this ship holds no weaponry. The ship is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters.(||) You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and R.Gunne.</t>

 <t id="4804">New on the public market, developed by the Аргон military to receive accurate tactical information on its neighbours. The Camera Drone has been updated over the last decade to incorporate the newest in video capture technology to feed live information to the person who remotely controls the device.(||) Today the device is used to survey new sectors and planets, as well as spying on neighbours and monitoring enemy activities.</t>
 <t id="4811">Advanced Satellite Factory</t>

 <t id="4823">Ore Collector</t>
 <t id="4824">After Ore has been broken up by a mobile drilling system, the smaller rocks can be brought into the cargo bay using this new device. It works by targeting the smaller rocks with a low powered gravity beam, bringing the ore into the bay ready to be sold.</t>
 <t id="4833">Camouflage Device</t>
 <t id="4834">This is a specialised device originally developed for spy missions by the Паранід, the technology behind the device is Невідомий. It renders the ship invisible to gravidar and to sight. Because of its dangerous nature it is now considered highly illegal in most sectors as there are fears that if the device falls into either Pirate or Ксенон hands, any of the sentient races would be at risk to attack.(||) Although there are rumours that each race military has a covert operations squadron equipped these devices.</t>
 <t id="4863">Spacefly Collector</t>
 <t id="4864">Although illegal, Spacefly collecting has become the highly paid good in the universe. These small creatures are captured by a high resonance wave of the device, attracting them inside of hold.(||) These spaceflies are then sold to anyone who will take them, automatically making a profit. This activity is illegal but within pirate communities it has become a way of life.</t>
 <t id="4871">альфа PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4872">Originally a Weapons Research Laboratory for Аргон scientists, now home to the production of the Photon Pulse Cannon. A powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4873">альфа Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4874">First developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Аргон, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the Аргон Military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation.</t>
 <t id="4881">бета PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4882">An upgraded PPC Forge, the бета Version is more powerful with a longer construction process. The PPC is a powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>

 <t id="4913">Needle</t>
 <t id="4923">Thorn</t>
 <t id="4932">The Perseus is the successor to the Prometheus. Its first test run was considered an embarrassment to the Паранід as it was stolen by a Pirate, leading to their request for external help to recover it.(||) The ship was initially tested with shields used for corvette ships but they wrecked havoc with some of the internal systems so they were changed for above standard sizes.</t>
 <t id="4941">Lasertower Weapon Forge</t>
 <t id="4942">This factory produces the lasertower weapon. This weapon is incompatible with all ships. It can only be used in the lasertower defence platform.(||) The station uses high tech machinery to assemble this weapon, it is a very dangerous process which uses plasma energy.</t>
 <t id="4943">Lasertower Weapon</t>
 <t id="4944">This is the primary high-energy plasma beam that is used in Lasertowers. Its main energy systems make this weapon incompatible with large ships for the time being(||), although scientists are trying to find a way to remedy this situation.(||) Аргон scientists first developed this weapon by accident when using a photon enhanced гамма radiation, which created a beam laser.</t>
 <t id="4951">Mass Driver Forge</t>
 <t id="4952">Mass Drivers are a new invention by the Аргон and Спліт. It makes use of the magnetic firing system that allows the projectile to be fired out at rapid speed without the need for chemical or laser based firing systems. Projectiles are bought separately and are sold in Ammunition Crates.</t>
 <t id="4953">Mass Driver</t>
 <t id="4954">This weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi barrelled cannon, which is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.(||) It inflicts damage not due power of individual projectiles but because of the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the unique nature of this weapon's ammunition it has almost no effect on a ship's shields but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain due to the fact that its ammunition supplies all energy requirements. Currently the weapon can only be fitted to Аргон and Спліт ships as they are the only ships that can accommodate the ammunition feed system. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition.</t>
 <t id="4961">Ammunition Factory</t>
 <t id="4962">This factory is devoted to the creation and distribution of Ammunition for the Mass Driver weapon.(||) Projectiles are created for hardened steel, which is produced on the station. Each projectile is then put into feed crates that are sold and are placed directly into the Mass Driver weapon system.</t>
 <t id="4963">Mass Driver Ammunition</t>
 <t id="4964">This is special ammunition for use in the Mass Driver. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself and a small armour piercing shell which is then encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered, by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy. This pack contains 200 rounds.</t>
 <t id="4971">TerraCorp Headquarters</t>
 <t id="4972">This is the most important station belonging to the TerraCorp Company based in Home of Light. Parts of this facility are open to the public, although most of the station is closed to personnel only. These include research facilities and company offices. A range of technology can be found here, and some rare devices that are only offered by one particular race. Materials are often required and are bought by the TerraCorp Company for a fair price.(||) A small fleet of ships can usually be found nearby making the station highly guarded. The station also incorporates state of the art recreation and commerce facilities, including Hotels, Sport Domes, Cinemas and Restaurants. Most races are welcome here to trade.</t>

 <t id="5051">Navigational Beacon</t>
 <t id="5052">Hazard Warning Beacons are placed by civilian militias to mark out the trade routes in dangerous sectors, they emit pulses of light that show the trade lanes between gates and stations.(||) By flying close to these beacons you can be assured of a safe flight, although Пірат sometimes use these trade routes as target practice.</t>
 <t id="5061">Federal Аргон Installation</t>
 <t id="5062">This installation can be found across Аргон Territory near to zones of war, or the edges of their territory. It is heavily guarded with several squadrons of fighters and military transport craft. Access can be granted to some traders so they can upgrade their ships or even join the Federal Аргон Police Militias.(||) Built using the same design station as the Аргон trade docks, the installations interior however does not resemble these popular stations. They have military testing ranges and fighter research facilities.</t>
 <t id="5071">Royal Boron Research Station</t>
 <t id="5072">This design of station is credited with coming across great finds. The facility researches anything from weapons and ships to archaeology and medical equipment.(||) It can usually be found in orbit of planets with a high scientific interest. With several squadrons of the best boron fighters, this station is heavily guarded. Traders can come to this station to bring food and supplies to this station.</t>
 <t id="5081">Паранід Communications Facility</t>
 <t id="5082">This station is an adapted dock whose main purpose is to monitor and keep track of all forms of communication. Normal traders are allowed on board to trade in its limited cargo space where one can find all forms of communication equipment, ranging from Advanced Satellites to the basic communication equipment.(||) Some other goods can also be traded here if in surplus or if needed by the stations civilian and military crew. Most sections of this station on one hand are out of bounds.</t>
 <t id="5091">Аргон One</t>
 <t id="5092">{17,3112}</t>
 <t id="5111">Аргон Merchant Scrapyard</t>
 <t id="5112">This station is run by civilian Scrap Merchants. They deal in old ship hulls that are no longer space worthy.(||) Whenever a ship is cashed in, the customer will get a fair shipment of ore from the Merchants in return. The rest of the materials are kept by the scrapyard to be sold later, be used for other purposes or disposed off. The stations cargo bays are usually filled with hulks of old ships that are yet to be processed, some could be repaired, while others are too badly damaged.</t>

 <t id="5203">Artefacts</t>
 <t id="5204">Relics of ancient civilisations can be found all over the universe. These artefacts vary in size and shape, but most were built with sophisticated advanced technology. The origins of these artefacts is still unclear and Аргон and Boron archaeologists are working to decipher their purpose.</t>
 <t id="5213">Artificial Fertilizer</t>
 <t id="5214">In recent jazuras the Аргон Agriculture Council has decided that it is unsafe to use Natural Fertilizer from the Argnu Cattle. This artificial fertiliser created by the AAC contains all the essential elements that plants need for growth, but eliminates the ones that are harmful to other life-forms.</t>
 <t id="5223">Biological Micro-Organisms</t>
 <t id="5224">These micro-organisms are used by the Boron to create new and advanced pharmaceuticals.(||) Using their advanced genetic techniques, the Boron have discovered many cures to previously incurable diseases. The regulation of these micro-organisms is now controlled in most sectors by the Boron Medical Council. The Boron actively search out new species and have discovered varieties that are used to manufacture fertilizer and to treat radioactive waste.</t>
 <t id="5233">Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="5234">Designed and produced by the military, these cartography chips contain important information on individual sectors or the universe as a whole. They detail the positions of all known military facilities and stellar phenomena.</t>
 <t id="5243">Construction Equipment</t>
 <t id="5244">Modern construction equipment is designed to allow the construction of vast space stations safely and quickly. It is vital for the economic growth of all races.</t>
 <t id="5253">Engine Components</t>
 <t id="5254">Engine components are used in the manufacture and repair of spacecraft engines. The plasma drive is the most common engine system used in modern spacecraft.(||) It makes use of a high energy ionised plasma stream from a fusion core to propel the ship. These drives are very stable and simple in construction and need little maintenance.</t>
 <t id="5263">Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="5264">Entertainment chips contain films, books, or interactive entertainment. They are used all throughout the known universe. Many Boron titles, however, have been banned in the Спліт sectors.</t>
 <t id="5273">Food Rations</t>
 <t id="5274">Small packs of food usually used in combat or refugee conditions.(||) These packs of food contain freeze-dried Argnu beef, dried BoFu and water rations. Although not appetizing, these foods can mean the difference between life and starvation.</t>
 <t id="5283">Hand Weapons</t>
 <t id="5284">There are many different designs of hand weapons to allow for the physical capabilities of each race. They range from Knives and swords to sophisticated military guns and rifles.</t>
 <t id="5293">Luxury Foodstuffs</t>
 <t id="5294">Many planets produce they own Luxury Foodstuffs that are coveted by connoisseurs all over the universe.(||) They are packed into refrigerated boxes and shipped quickly to their destination. Because of the cost and short shelf-life these foodstuffs are usually only used at important functions.</t>
 <t id="5303">Medical Equipment</t>
 <t id="5304">Medical equipment can be found all over the universe. This equipment can range from small medicinal bottles to life support systems and portable operating theatres.</t>
 <t id="5313">Mining Equipment</t>
 <t id="5314">Mining Equipment, produced by the Galactic Mining Authority, is used to repair or replace equipment on Asteroid Mines. The equipment ranges from the standard mining drill to advanced laser equipment.</t>
 <t id="5323">Nividium</t>
 <t id="5324">Nividium is a rare mineral that is found in some larger asteroid fields located in the universe. Its use is limited, although it has been used as a superconductor. Nividium in its purest form is traded as a unique and valuable commodity.</t>
 <t id="5333">Radioactive Waste</t>
 <t id="5334">Radioactive waste is by-product of weapon production, especially the Hornet Missile.(||) Until recently the only way to dispose off the waste was to dump it in disused silicon mines. The Boron have discovered a micro-organism in the sector Легка Вода that digests the harmful waste and excretes a inert material. How this useful radiation resistant organism evolved is Невідомий.</t>
 <t id="5343">Teladianium Panelling</t>
 <t id="5344">Teladianium panelling as produced in rolling mills at shipyards and when added to a ship's hull provides extra protection from space borne particles.</t>
 <t id="5353">Water</t>
 <t id="5354">Water is transported in large gas free containers all over the universe.(||) Many sectors have few natural sources of water and have to transport their requirements for drinking and cleaning. In these sectors the water supply is the most important commodity.</t>
 <t id="5363">Weapon Interface Chips</t>
 <t id="5364">More commonly known as WICs, these weapon interface chips are used in large laser based weapons. They are an interface between the ships computer and weapon, designed to help regulate the energy flow and to prevent illegal modification. Weapons can not operate without these chips.</t>
 <t id="5373">Narcotics</t>
 <t id="5374">Narcotics are used widely within the pirate community. These drugs alter the person's perceptions and brain functions.(||) Unfortunately these effects cannot be controlled and the narcotics can usually result in unwanted side effects and in some cases death.</t>
 <t id="5383">Super Slave Chips</t>
 <t id="5384">Slave chips are a neural implant that is used to allow pilots of spacecraft to have direct control over his or her ship.(||) The Super Slave has better range using the same hub technology, improved perception, longer use and most importantly a built in fail safe device.</t>
 <t id="5393">Spacefly Eggs</t>
 <t id="5394">The eggs of the Markus Spacefly are very rarely found. It is believed that they lay their eggs in hollow asteroids when conditions are correct. Unfortunately it has become popular to collect unhatched eggs as they are very decorative with colourful patterns.(||) Trade in these items is illegal and any trader caught can expect a lengthy prison sentence.</t>
 <t id="5403">Pirate Sidearms</t>
 <t id="5404">Unlike the military issue hand weapons, these Pirate sidearms have been declared illegal by most races. They are popular amongst Пірат as they are very effect at short range and even minor wounds can be fatal.(||) The favoured pirate sidearm is the rare IMB-42 Blaster which literally rips the molecular structure of a living organism apart. Transportation and owning these weapons is a capital offence in some sectors.</t>
 <t id="5413">Hackerchips</t>
 <t id="5414">A new and expensive computer chip created by some raider parties. These Hacker chips are designed as an adaptive hacking tool, automatically redirecting signals, creating viruses and generally making a hacker's life easier.(||) They are easily identifiable because they contain their own power source - a small fusion battery that powers the chip for a Jazura.</t>
 <t id="5423">Military Personnel</t>
 <t id="5424">The military always have to move personnel around at short notice. For this purpose they often employ freelance pilots. These passengers usually carry weapons and other goods and their destinations might be dangerous.</t>
 <t id="5433">Passengers</t>
 <t id="5434">All races have access to commercial space craft, these ships can take large groups of passengers to space stations or to other planets or systems.</t>
 <t id="5443">Very Important Passengers</t>
 <t id="5444">A very special passenger with very special requirements for travelling. They usually have several security guards and travel with a large amount of luggage.</t>
 <t id="5453">Duplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5454">Research and development of the Gravidar technology has resulted in the Duplex Scanner, which increases the scanners range by a factor of 2. This enables targets to be acquired at much greater range.</t>
 <t id="5463">Triplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5464">The Triplex scanner increases the Gravidar scanner range by a factor of 3. The technology used detects greater variations in the gravitational anomalies that are generated by stations.(||) This information is then processed and fed directly to both the sector map and the Gravidar display.</t>

<page id="19" title="Sectordescription" descr="Long descriptions of all sectors" voice="0">
 <t id="1030101">This sector contains one of the most varied selections of products in the known universe. Equipment, raw materials, ship upgrades and installations of many types can be traded here in a relatively secure environment. This is the Boron home world and a place of quiet contemplation and study.</t>
 <t id="1030102">The Boron produce high quality electronics and semi-organic computer systems as well as more conventional goods in this large and crowded sector. The supporting factories produce a wealth of raw materials for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030103">This sector provides cheap, clean power to all the Boron sectors. The Boron's ecologically sensitive ideology requires all power used in Boron sectors, even planetary power supplies, to be produced space-side.</t>
 <t id="1030104">The Boron and Теладі trade amicably in this peaceful sector. As with all Boron sectors, the economy is heavily reliant on agriculture and imported raw materials. The beguiling organic shapes of Boron Space Trading Stations are a constant reminder of their aquatic origins.</t>
 <t id="1030105">On the border between Теладі and Boron space, this system acts as a major commercial centre for trade between the Foundation and Profit Guilds, as well as providing large amounts of raw mineral resources. Although the Спліт rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Теладі. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the Більший Прибуток of the Теладі of course.</t>
 <t id="1030106">Once the favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector is now managed by the Теладі and has become the preferred destination of fun seekers, weedheads and space-hippies of every race. The Bliss Place in the centre of the sector produces the narcotic spaceweed, the meditative drug of choice for the dreamers, artists and neo-philosophers that are drawn here.</t>
 <t id="1030107">On the Спліт-Теладі border, this sector is the focal point for much of the limited trade between the Спліт and other species. The two Теладі systems between Сім'я Ві and the nearest Boron system provide a buffer between the two feuding species. It is usual, however, to find Спліт on guard against the unlikely threat of a Boron sneak attack.</t>
 <t id="1030114">While the Теладі Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector may choose to disagree. Сховище is a system hard to reach by normal means, this sector contains nothing but high tech stations. Сховище is also home to the Теладі Company's main research facility, always trying to improve upon current technology. Whilst this sector is relatively new, it is thought that it will be expanded further with new ship design and construction facilities. Work has already begun here on a replacement for the aging heavy freighters employed by Теладі traders.</t>
 <t id="1030117">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030118">Discovered while exploring Гетсу Ф'юне, this sector was cleared of Ксенон by a small force of ships, unfortunately soon after this mission was completed the Аргон destroyer was ambushed. Its Captain's last report stated that the Ксенон entered the sector from an unexplored gate, the position of which was not recorded. The Destroyer was never heard from again. The sector has rarely been entered since and is considered by the Аргон to be somewhat cursed in its nature.</t>
 <t id="1030120">The existence of this sector was thought to be little more than a legend. That was until a lone Boron pilot, crazed with fear and exhaustion, was picked up in the Menelaus Paradise sector. He died shortly after rescue, babbling desperately about an eternal cosmic horror buried deep in the skin of a 'dark planet'. Since then Аргон spy probes have been sent in to investigate; as of yet, no discovery has been made public.</t>
 <t id="1030201">On the border of Аргон and Boron space the populated planets of this system are a popular vacation destination for Аргон high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings. The very best in Аргон cuisine is made in this system. The Equipment Dock provides a wide choice of weapons and upgrades for combat ships and pleasure-cruisers alike.</t>
 <t id="1030202">Sometime before the last Ксенон conflict the planet 'Shipfall' was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Аргон industrial colony. Some effort has been made to re-establish the colony since, but its activities are currently restricted mainly to mining and agriculture.</t>
 <t id="1030203">This sector was once occupied by the Аргон Federation's largest station, the Antigone. It was attacked in 215 by the largest Ксенон fleet known to date. The station launched its defence fleet when one of the Ксенон ships fired into the docking bays, destroying several fighter wings and setting off a chain reaction from damaged propulsion systems in the process. The station was destroyed, killing thousands of people. Some crew and visitors managed to make it out through emergency escape pods that were recovered once the Ксенон had retreated. In one of the largest recovery efforts ever made by the Аргон, medevac ships were dispatched to assist. One of these, the Springbird, was attacked while leaving the sector, forcing it into the atmosphere of the planet 'Sandwell'. All contact was subsequently lost. The recovery operation was extended to find survivors on the planet surface, none were ever located, perhaps due to the scorching heat from the local star. The outpost has now become a place of remembrance for the many Аргон who travel here to honour their war dead.</t>
 <t id="1030204">This system supplies most of the weaponry used by the Boron Military in their sporadic battles against the Спліт, in addition to the defence of their systems from Pirate and Ксенон raiders. As it is the main supply and outfitting depot for the Boron space-fleet, it is a prime target for Спліт attacks should hostilities resume between the two species.</t>
 <t id="1030205">The factory and refinery workers of Частка Прибутку are renowned for working hard - and partying even harder. The Bliss place can be rough at a cycle's end - on refinery pay-day when the dice are loaded and the stakes are high, tempers can get frayed. The smokeshacks and speakeasies of Частка Прибутку are commonly frequented by the more colourful Pirate crews.</t>
 <t id="1030206">With a wealth of untapped mineral resources and busy commercial and industrial installations, trade in the Теладі's home system is potentially very lucrative. Although well policed, the wealth of this system attracts opportunistic Pirate activity. To guard the profit of the many, a Теладі Destroyer often stands guard over this sector.</t>
 <t id="1030207">This system provides the Спліт with a wide variety of food and raw materials as well as being the production centre for their heavy ship's Pulse Beam Lasers. Far from the 'wild space' this system is relatively safe from pirate attack although occasional skirmishes are reported.</t>
 <t id="1030214">A highly defended system, for reasons that only the Теладі and few others know about. Shareholders Fortune is a new sector developed around a small field of large asteroids. The Теладі believed that this system would provide them with a source of Nividium, a rare material found in only some parts of the universe. After they found out their research ship was incorrect in this assumption the Теладі had to turn to building new factories for high-demand technologies.</t>
 <t id="1030215">When the Теладі Mining Executive came across this system, they sent several of their Explorer Ships to evaluate the systems resources. One of the ships, the Mercantile, came across abandoned space stations set into some of the mineral-rich asteroids. The technology seemed to be similar to the Аргон, however they denied ever having held a presence there. The neighbouring system already belonged to the Теладі, so they quickly moved in, re-aligning the gates with the standard navigation system, near to the alien mines. After retrofitting the stations with Теладі technology, the largest Теладі mining operation in history opened for business.</t>
 <t id="1030218">This very remote system was discovered several Jazuras ago by chance by an adventurer. The governments of the individual races could not agree on who should administer this system in the future. In order to underline their own requirement in this area of space each race built space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Спліт, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition period as independent administrator of this region. Each government also sent their own space workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, and even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, in which another female star warrior found her way into the X Universe. The system is now under administration by the Terracorp, who are starting to bring in their own stations and occupy empty spaces within the commerce grid.</t>
 <t id="1030219">The planet 'Oceania' is a huge world enveloped in swirling coloured mists and encircled with spectacular dust rings. It is a popular meditative resort for Boron monks who spend weeks in isolation in the planet's aquatic wilderness to contemplate the purpose and meaning of life. The installations here service these pilgrims' basic needs.</t>
 <t id="1030220">Although many ships have been sent to survey this sector, few have returned. Once shunned by all the sentient species, last surveillance records show the system was home to a pirate base that the Ксенон constantly placed under attack. Pirate forces set this base up in search of easy pickings when the Ксенон fleet jumped to the neighbouring grid 596, only to find the Ксенон returned a few wozuras later. With access to the gate blocked, evacuation attempts were futile, leaving them with no option except to hold their position. Their survival in this sector is still a case for much debate.</t>
 <t id="1030301">This system is sparsely populated, dedicated purely to the production of raw materials and food for installations in the surrounding systems. The presence of weapons production facilities requires heavy protection by Federation ships against sabotage attacks from Пірат seeking to weaken Аргон defences.</t>
 <t id="1030302">The Аргон mine workers in this mineral rich system are famed across space for their ability to consume vast quantities of Space Fuel. Their semi-legal bootlegging operation keeps the miners happy and the bosses rich. Strong liquor loosens tongues and the system is a hive of gossip, rumour and dubious scuttlebuzz.</t>
 <t id="1030303">This Аргон system's economy is heavily reliant on trade between the Аргон and their Boron allies. The Foundation Guild has its Headquarters here and the Trading Station is the temporary seat of the newly founded Boron Chamber of Commerce. The many cattle ranches here supply Argnu Beef for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030304">The planet 'Tethys' has a huge population and the Boron are determined to protect the billions living there from the dangerous lawlessness of nearby 'uncivilised' systems. The local economy is very reliant on import of raw materials - most notably Teladianium which is required by the many Bio-Gas Factories.</t>
 <t id="1030305">This system is jealously guarded by the Теладі as it contains scarce organic and mineral resources. The seas of Phobass IV produce kilometre high waves - the best surfing in the universe bar none! The system has a thriving tourist trade based mainly on Boron day-trips to the Planet's many underwater resorts.</t>
 <t id="1030306">A relatively safe system, ideal for short trading runs and a debut in factory ownership. The Sun Oil Refineries in this system and more in the surrounding systems are reliant on imported sunrise flowers - making this an ideal location for a Solar Power Plant and Dream Farm.</t>
 <t id="1030307">Thuruks Pride produces a lot of the complex computers and hardware required by Спліт warships. Plentiful and cheap energy, and a variety of natural raw materials make this system a lucrative high-tech manufacturing center. Спліт and Паранід technology are combined in this sector to produce efficient and powerful beam weapons.</t>
 <t id="1030308">The home system of the Спліт, Сімейна Гордість is a major resupply point for the Спліт military as well as having a bustling civilian commercial district. Its primary planet houses the HQ of the Council of All Families - the martial government that rules over Спліт affairs.</t>
 <t id="1030310">Originally discovered and claimed by the Спліт Patriarch as a hideaway, this sector is now a thriving commercial colony. It is from here that the Спліт Patriarch ordered his forces to repel the attacks from the rebelling Сім'я Ронкар. In the final tazuras of the war, this sector was made impenetrable with three of the Patriarch's latest prototype destroyers. They managed to defend the sector with their armament of 20 plasma throwers per ship. The Rhonkar family eventually found a way around this blockade. They sent in a small fleet of heavy fighters that made a successful kamikaze run against the command vessel and destroyed it. Then a combined Rhonkar - Njy fleet attacked, eliminating the other two prototypes. The Patriarch was captured and deposed. The plans of these prototypes were lost in battle.</t>
 <t id="1030315">The border of Теладі and Спліт space in this part of the universe is located in this system. Trade between the Теладі and the Спліт Families T'kr and Njy usually takes place in this oddly designed system. Arranged by the Паранід sector designer, Almanckessat, this systems arrangement is thought to bring forth good fortune, to which the Паранід claim a great deal of in the name of their empire, much to the chagrin of the Теладі, to whom Дім Можливості is the capital of their local sectors.</t>
 <t id="1030319">This small Boron outpost produces mineral products as well as the highly regarded Stotts Spices. It has attracted little hostile attention so far. The Boron tolerate the Спліт using this system as a convenient route to unexplored space in return for safe passage of Boron craft through certain Спліт systems.</t>
 <t id="1030401">This outpost of basic installations acts as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area. It produces only the basic products most required by small ships and installations. The system is the spiritual home of the popular Аргон sport known as 'Hardball'.</t>
 <t id="1030402">Bathed in the sacred light of the sun 'Sonra', the Аргон home system is dominated by the planet 'Аргон Prime'. This rich and beautiful world is densely populated and is usually protected by a large Аргон Military force, a Titan Destroyer and more recently the Аргон's latest flagship carrier, the Аргон One, a Colossus class Carrier. Most of the needs of the Аргон space fleet are catered for here in orbiting shipyards that also outfit private fighters and transport ships with Аргон technology.</t>
 <t id="1030403">This system provides much needed power and food to the Аргон Military as well as providing a convenient temporary HQ for the rapid response squads set up against Pirate activity and Ксенон insurgence. It is often used as a base to recharge long range recon ships and carriers and as a result is a well defended and often dangerous system during times of conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030404">Originally discovered and declared lifeless by the earth science vessel 'Winterblossom', under the command of Rene Farnham, this system is now a lawless community of high-tech criminals. The illegal computer and weapons systems covertly built here are renowned for innovation if not reliability. None of which you will find publicly available. The hackers and cyberpunks who operate here are notoriously paranoid and are heavily guarded by armed enforcers.</t>
 <t id="1030405">Deep in unclaimed space this system is little more than a long established and well respected ambush. Rogue Теладі and Аргон stations provide cover for aggressive Pirate strike forces. A single, cratered moon holds the wrecks of many of the ships disabled, stripped and left to fall to its surface by freebooters, hullcutters and privateers.</t>
 <t id="1030406">A busy and lucrative system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Блакитний Прибуток is most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Теладі factory workers. Combining Теладі reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Аргон and Теладі percussion instruments, 'Теладі Blues' is appreciated by many sentient species.</t>
 <t id="1030407">The powerful Rhonkar Family runs this large Спліт weapons outpost. It is a heavily industrialized system with a lack of warmth and lays emphasis on functionality that is common to all Спліт space installations. Rhonkar Family warriors patrol their property efficiently and deal with unwanted guests with little courtesy.</t>
 <t id="1030408">This sparse system is primarily dedicated to the production of food. The Rastar Oil refineries rely on pirate stations for their supplies of space flies and import all other raw materials from outside the system. A dense, mineral-rich asteroid field fills the whole system. Спліт superstition forbids mining on the largest of these asteroids, claiming them to be cursed.</t>
 <t id="1030409">Prevented by the Аргон from invading Boron territory, the Спліт have set out to colonising the space around their own systems. Сонце Тарка was the first of these new colonies, its mineral resources and agricultural plants providing raw materials for the Спліт push into new systems.</t>
 <t id="1030410">The Спліт secured this mineral rich system from the Ксенон rearguard early after the last Ксенон conflict but sustained heavy losses doing so. It now exists as a welcome, if rough, trading post on a busy route between many species' systems. Few communities hate the Ксенон more than the inhabitants of this system.</t>
 <t id="1030415">This sector is home to the disgraced family T'kr, who were held responsible for a tragic incident that destroyed a Спліт shipyard and killed five hundred Спліт. What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was, the then Patriarch of All Спліт, using T'kr as a sign to all Спліт that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it has been only in recent jazuras that the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also marks the border for the Теладі 'fortune' system block. Three sectors that the Теладі use for production, and also contain the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system.</t>
 <t id="1030416">Once owned by the T'kr Family, this was a hub of activity. Mining was the main job here, but after the Dragon Incident this sector was seized by the neighbouring Njy family under orders form the Patriarch of all Спліт. Now the sector has run into disrepair, new stations have been built but are poorly maintained, pirate activity has increased and remnants of a minefield placed by T'kr to stop the seizure of the system can be found hidden in nebula streams. Pilots are asked to take caution in this system, as these mines could still be operational.</t>
 <t id="1030417">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further in this area of space this Спліт colony is heavily guarded and produces surveillance equipment and defensive weapons, allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. A covert Federation intelligence group in turn watch the Спліт for signs of aggression against the peace loving Boron.</t>
 <t id="1030418">Located next to Спліт space this system is usually on a knife edge of tension. The Boron have no military presence here lest they give the Спліт an excuse to attack and instead rely on the covert intelligence and good will of other species to dissuade the Спліт from aggression.</t>
 <t id="1030419">This system was the centre of the Ксенон weapons test zone during the last conflict. The system's planet was blown apart by an experimental weapon, probably the rumoured 'Galaxy Killer' device - used to vapourise and ignite the still burning 'Hadesfire Nebulae'. It is now a laid-back Boron mining and farming colony.</t>
 <t id="1030501">The Аргон military have taken full advantage of the rich resources in this area. Competition is fierce with many companies all competing for business. There are still profit opportunities, however, in mining for the export market. The station here acts as a resupply point for Аргон Military fighters and a good selection of surplus weapon systems can be found there.</t>
 <t id="1030502">Scattered in the shadow of the now terraformed planet 'Kho's Haven', this recently re-colonised system's installations are mainly concerned with the production of high quality electronics and fabrics. Lax security arrangements make this system a favourite route for Pirate raiding parties looking for richer pickings.</t>
 <t id="1030503">Now little more than a smouldering shell, Presidents End stands testament to the ferocity of the Хаак. What little remains here has been left untouched, a silent memorial and burial ground to the countless souls who lost their lives, unable to escape this sector's final demise. With gates that link to areas that hold even greater anarchy, Аргон security patrols struggle to maintain any semblance of control over the sector. Plans to rebuild are still held back by the fear of further reprisals. Perhaps in time Presidents End will see a new beginning, until then, this sector remains in mourning. </t>
 <t id="1030504">Despite the impression of respectability afforded to this system through the honoured name of Elena Kho, this asteroid-strewn colony is a favourite haunt of cut-throats, smugglers, wrecksweepers and hullcutters. The system has come to be a reliable, if illegal, source of controlled and specialized weaponry.</t>
 <t id="1030505">Weapons are required by many of the hidden outposts and illicit operations in unclaimed space. This system provides some of the necessary supplies and is protected by both a covert Pirate presence and a thick asteroid field. The mineral content of these asteroids is likely to cause a conflict between the smugglers and the legitimate mining corporations sooner or later.</t>
 <t id="1030506">Highly destructive PAC/PPC Weapons are built here under strict Теладі Military guard. Most of the personnel in this system are tied to the military arm of the Profit Guild or the smaller Теладі Company Navy. The market for recreational and luxury goods is high among those personnel on guard detail in a relatively safe system.</t>
 <t id="1030507">This system is the property of the Rhonkar Family, one of the dominant Спліт clans. Although this system was not always their property, it was seized during the last civil war with the Patriarch of all Спліт. Success here is ensured by slave labour, illegal mining methods and ruthless workforce control, this is not a matter that concerns the average Спліт.</t>
 <t id="1030510">Situated in a heavy asteroid belt this forbidding Спліт mining colony has grown into the second capital system of Спліт space. It is a successful trading location as well as providing much needed support for Спліт military ships. Run by the relatively liberal Thi Family this is the only Спліт system not using forced labour in its factories.</t>
 <t id="1030511">Established at the same time as 'Новий Дохід' this well organised Теладі system supports most of the ships travelling through newly colonised Теладі space. The inhospitable, rocky moon on the fringes of this system is used as a survival training ground for Теладі Company Profit-Protection troops.</t>
 <t id="1030517">This agricultural system is run by the brutally efficient Njy family. It produces many Спліт foodstuffs that are shipped to the two planets in this system and neighbouring systems. The Njy family is particularly brutal, offensive and arrogant, even by Спліт standards.</t>
 <t id="1030518">This system used to belong to the Спліт Family Ryk, but after a dispute with the Сім'я Ню, was taken in a rather strange battle. Njy outfitted some of their freighters with large explosives and changed their transmitter signal to say they were from Сім'я Ві, they later sent a distress signal saying they were under attack by Пірат. The Ryk Family Carrier came in to assist the freighters that were near the west gate, but when it was in range each of the six freighters simultaneously exploded, heavily damaging the carrier. Njy then moved in their destroyers and attacked the Ryk's military forces, destroying the carrier with relative ease, and seizing the system in the name of the Сім'я Ню.</t>
 <t id="1030519">This is the home to the once great Ryk Family. After a territorial dispute with the Njy family, Ryk lost one of their two outposts. The second colony is this system, which was taken from the ownership of the last Patriarch who fell in a great battle with Сім'я Ронкар. Unlike some other systems in the local area, this system is relatively uninteresting, but one may find the odd skirmish between the neighbouring Boron colony and the Ryk Family. </t>
 <t id="1030601">This crowded system produces high quality food, clothing and computer equipment for the neighbouring systems. A strange religious sect reside here in a huge orbiting temple, searching for the secrets of sentient life in the Universe by studying ancient legends and deep historical analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030602">This mining outpost is surrounded by a field of mineral bearing asteroids with a particularly dense asteroid field to the north. Pirate activity is light and generally non-aggressive, mostly transports headed for the north gate. This is fortunate as high-speed combat in this system is made difficult by the asteroids which also play havoc with missile targeting scanners.</t>
 <t id="1030603">This quiet and unassuming system is a resupply point for the Аргон military. Hostile activity is generally minimal as it is well guarded by security patrols. The space equipment dock is a useful source of surplus military equipment as well as second hand kit used by the many Аргон Military training outposts in the area.</t>
 <t id="1030604">Much of the illicit trading in the known universe goes on in this system. Пірат and smugglers trade with all races and act as go-betweens for sensitive or illegal deals between species. There is a thriving industry in the cheap, counterfeit Паранід jewellery that is often used as conveniently anonymous payment in black market deals.</t>
 <t id="1030605">The last Ксенон conflict with the sentient races brought forth many heroes. This system is named after one of the foremost of those who risked all to repel the Ксенон threat. Although the name still has deep echoes of honour, courage and wisdom, the system is corrupt and dangerous. The Аргон are particularly concerned that the use of this system as a base for the slave trade is an insult to one of their most honoured names.</t>
 <t id="1030606">Although this system is a hive of Agricultural and Industrial activity many respectable traders and merchants avoid it. Adventure seekers and rogues of all species frequent this system, the often Pirate Base is a real den of iniquity and squalor. This system is a major link in the Спліт - Теладі trade route and its safety is jealously protected by the Profit Guild.</t>
 <t id="1030607">On the fringes of civilised space this deep space system is no stranger to raids by Пірат and other hostile ships. Founded by the Спліт leader Thuruk as a prison colony for Boron captured during their wars it has evolved into a thriving industrial outpost.</t>
 <t id="1030611">Situated between two uninhabitable dust planets this relatively new Теладі system produces raw materials as well as light weapons for military and exploration ships. This system is earmarked by the Profit Guild for priority expansion and investment.</t>
 <t id="1030612">This system is home to the organisation that controls the supply of the rare mineral Nividium. Its factories produces high-quality weapons for the Теладі as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by both the PTNI's security arm as well as Теладі Company ships.</t>
 <t id="1030614">This Аргон colony was founded by Kleo Gult, head of the Аргон Agricultural Council, but as work continued, it was discovered that more uses could be found for the system. The sector is owned by the AAC which means very little money has been put aside for updating non-essential technology. Residents have thus needed to find a way to make money apart from selling wares and produce. It is believed that there are some illegal goods being sold in the sector, but this has yet to be proven as residents police and protect this sector themselves. Streams of nebula also inhabit this system, and Коло Праці is usually home to several scientists who try to find a way to mine this untouched resource. The system is unusual as the sun bursts with strong phases of intense light.</t>
 <t id="1030616">This system was once a Спліт mining outpost. One Tazura a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by Аргон Federation security operatives in Чорне Сонце. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a shattered, radioactive hell. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Ксенон super-weapon is to blame and access to the system is now restricted. Pilots who passed though this system once said that there was a large ship in this system, but recently these reports have stopped. If this ship existed, then it is Невідомий where it has gone now.</t>
 <t id="1030617">This deep space system is about as close as the Спліт get to a civilian operation. It produces food and other organic products and mines the asteroids that are spread throughout the system. Although there is little military presence here all Спліт are required to complete combat training and civilian Спліт pilots are no easy target.</t>
 <t id="1030701">The Ore and Silicon mines in this system provide mineral resources to the entire Паранід Empire. These energy hungry mines operate continuously, their workers dedicating their labour to the glory of the Xaar. The Паранід Empire permits limited mining on the untapped asteroids in this sector but only Паранід may enter the sacred mines on the 'rusty planet' XylaXaar.</t>
 <t id="1030702">The jewel of the Паранід Empire produces some of the finest ship equipment available - devastating thermo-nuclear missiles, semi-organic ship hulls, artificially intelligent flight systems and highly powerful lasers are among the tech products to be found. The skies of Паранід Прайм are dominated by a fiery gas cloud, the aftermath of a terrible Ксенон experiment.</t>
 <t id="1030703">Although this system is primarily concerned with agricultural production, the factories in this system make it a prime target for raiding or sabotage. The stormy ringed planet that dominates this system is currently being terraformed by the Паранід for inhabitation in the near future.</t>
 <t id="1030704">This system manufactures hardware for the refit yards in Гряда Імператора. It also provides masses of mineral and organic products to be consumed by their crews. Despite a heavy security around the military installations the Space Jewellery workshop provides rich pickings for the more aggressive and desperate looters and Пірат based in nearby systems.</t>
 <t id="1030705">This lawless system is the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants have made a fortune trading illicit goods, many, many more have been ripped-off, ambushed, swindled, bushwhacked, conned, assaulted, hijacked, stranded, killed or worse.</t>
 <t id="1030706">Bathed in the scorched glow of a burning nebula, this system was levelled by the devastating experimental weaponry used by Ксенон forces in the last great conflict. Once a busy cosmopolitan trading outpost, it is now a rough and ready mining community run by smuggler overlords, possibly in the pay of the powerful Паранід Jewellery cartels.</t>
 <t id="1030707">After the Ксенон conflict this system was abandoned. When the retreating Ксенон completely destroyed a neighbouring system by forcing its twin suns to go nova, the colonies and factories of this system were eradicated. It is the home to many refugees of the last Ксенон war and the other minor wars that came before it. The people here begin to build new lives and homes while they mourn their past and hope for their future.</t>
 <t id="1030708">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Аргон after the last Ксенон war. Пагорб Аладни was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. The jump gate used by the Ксенон to retreat was left intact, allowing rapid exploration of the space beyond this system and the ruthless hunting of Ксенон stragglers by rogue squads of revenge-seeking veterans.</t>
 <t id="1030709">The ageing but brilliant nuclear scientist, Akeela Hartnell, had one dream: to create a string of artificial suns that would light her way, and provide solar power for the ever expanding colonisation of sectors and planets by all races. The vessel that would allow Akeela to see her dream set off on its journey, but as it cleared the Омікрон Ліри system the ship was hit by an asteroid travelling so fast that it was virtually impossible to avoid, greatly damaging the ship. The crew, except for Akeela, disembarked and made their escape from the ship at best speed. Akeela succeeded in getting the ship away from the inhabited sectors, but the resulting explosion changed the sectors gate that locked onto the Пагорб Аладни sector. For a project that nearly ended in disaster, Маяк Акіли is her gift to the people of the galaxy. A request by Akeela's last will and testament asked that the Аргон govern the new system, but it should be a free place, and a safe haven for all traders. The four glowing stars that once graced this sector, - the result of Akeela's dream, are all but faded and gone. Yet her dream remains in the hearts of many, and so the sector is named after her.</t>
 <t id="1030712">Dedicated mostly to the production of Nostrop Oil for use in the industrial installations in the neighbouring systems, Зелена Луска is situated in a small asteroid field near the garden planet 'Nature's Profit', the native home of the Swamp Plant and Sunrise Flower.</t>
 <t id="1030713">Named after the Аргон heroine and Гонер priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Аргон leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. It is now a rough place where times are hard and people harder. There is much illegal activity in this system and skirmishes are common.</t>
 <t id="1030714">Омікрон Ліри remains true to the courage and conviction of those who knew that this sector would not be the last will and testament to the battle fought against the Хаак. Here lie the souls of those not forgotten, those who understood that this would be the point at which all races would stand tall and take the battle onwards. Those remaining here are neither forsaken or left without hope. Life goes on, while in the shadows lurk the destroyers of worlds.</t>
 <t id="1030715">This struggling Аргон agricultural system is situated between the breathtaking planets 'Garleth Prime' and 'Garleth бета'. Recent attacks on supply lines by Ксенон forces have led to many fire-fights among the installations, asteroids and the busy trade routes in this system.</t>
 <t id="1030716">The furthest Federation outpost from Аргон Prime, this dangerous system is both a deep-space resupply point and military tracking station. Ксенон activity in this system is carefully monitored by a covert Federation branch who are rumoured to have an inaccessible base hidden near the storm-battered planet 'Hades'.</t>
 <t id="1030802">Perhaps the stunning gas nebulae that dominate the view in this system and the general atmosphere of peace and tranquillity are what inspire the gorgeous jewellery crafted by the Паранід here. The tiny masterpieces they craft from Majaglit can take years to complete and are collected avariciously by art enthusiasts from around the systems.</t>
 <t id="1030803">This highly agricultural system provides much of the Soja Beans that form the basis of the Паранід diet. The highly ionised water of the system's planet contains rare organic minerals that greatly improve the flavour of Beans nurtured in it. This system suffered particularly heavy losses in the last Ксенон conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030804">This system contains the main Equipment Dock used to refit medium Паранід Fighters. These weapons are of the highest quality and Паранід technology is extremely reliable. This system was hit heavily in the last Ксенон conflict and security is still tight. This system represents the far border of the 'Old Паранід Empire', the 'New Empire' consisting of territories claimed since the conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030808">This system serves as the source of ships and equipment for the Аргон settlement of areas of space recently claimed after the Ксенон conflict. The majority of traffic here is comprised of Аргон scout ships and transports headed from newly founded colonies and the fringe systems.</t>
 <t id="1030811">This busy Теладі colony was named in honour of the warriors and civilians of all species who perished in the first great Ксенон conflict. The system itself is sparse and lacks many basic comforts. The Теладі here are possibly even more avaricious and sneaky than their homeworld brothers.</t>
 <t id="1030812">There is no data on this sector save that it contains a huge watery planet known by the Boron as 'Saa-Russ' or 'Life of the Sea' which legend insists is inhabited by giant sea dragons. Many ships have set out to explore this system, very few have returned.</t>
 <t id="1030816">This strange system is named for a Гонер belief that Nathan R Gunne once visited this system, the reason for this belief is that when first entered, a piece of debris was found, after an investigation it was found to be from two ancient fleets. All the debris has been cleared up and a new system has been forged in the brown nitrogen dioxide nebula streams of the system. Pirate activity is also increased and has meant increased military patrols in this system. Many pilots tend to avoid the gas clouds, as pirate ships have been known to hide in the nebulas and then participate in surprise attacks. The local population are made of mixed labour level, from high tech support to miners. </t>
 <t id="1030817">The original name for this sector was Light Of Hope, until the Ксенон attacked many jazuras ago. It was clear that the sectors patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using small transport ships. Backup from the Аргон Military was sent; four Titan class destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with fighter wings. They were to escort the transport ships out of the system, but before they could get to the gate, Ксенон ships jumped in and overwhelmed the destroyers and carriers. All civilian ships and one destroyer, the Challenger, escaped. Three jazuras later, an Аргон force, with Boron assistance, took back Light Of Hope and it was renamed Пустирі, reflecting the carnage and debris that the force found.  Now cleared of that detritus and with the Ксенон threat now greatly diminished, its inhabitants strive to maintain a normal existence.</t>

 <t id="1030819">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030902">The name is deceiving, but there is a meaning. The sector is located close to the Ma'kare star, the dominating feature is the flare that streams though the system. Because the stations are located so close to the star, all stations were fitted with a new reflective Teladianium armour that allow for the flares to hit the station and only affect it slightly, although the shields do protect the stations by absorbing 80 percent of the energy, the rest is reflected back by the armour. The name comes from the high priest, who visited this sector shortly after discovery, back then the flare was still at a distance, and the moving star was also at a distance, so the sector was a void, any religious Паранід thought that the star that was drawing closer was an omen, and so many preachers came to see this, hence the name.</t>
 <t id="1030904">Despite fanciful miners' tales that the asteroids in this system are all made of solid Nividium they seem to be rich in only the more mundane ore and silicon. The two factories producing cheap, commercial jewellery for the export market are well defended against opportunistic attack but attract the occasional raids from determined freeloaders.</t>
 <t id="1030906">With the discovery of the North Gate in the neighbouring 'Берег Нескінченності' sector, Легка Вода was founded. With a mixture of food production and solar power generators, this system has grown in importance. The name Легка Вода was given to this sector as the only habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size, its surface being mostly covered in water. The Boron have recently founded a planet-based colony using materials that were destined for the Спадок ЛуМанкСтрату system before plans were scrapped.</t>
 <t id="1030908">This mining outpost is still being founded near the red gas giant 'Hitt's Eye'. The trading, food and materials installations are in place and waiting to service the eagerly awaited private mining outfits who are always looking for new sources of minerals.</t>
 <t id="1030910">The Теладі claimed this system with the sole intention of colonising the two massive planets here. The awful fate of the first scouting parties to the planets' surfaces and the discovery of the hostile nature of the indigenous life forms dwelling there have ended such plans and the system is slowly decaying into a place of fear, lawlessness and anarchy.</t>
 <t id="1030911">The Теладі have only recently re-discovered this historically important system. Іанамус Зура already has its own thriving economy, mainly due to its position on a busy trade route. It provides a broad range of raw materials to many neighbouring systems and serves as the HQ of both the Profit Guild and Теладі Company in the new territories.</t>
 <t id="1030917">Поміж Світів is so called because of its strange arrangement of planets, two planets inhabit the system and create a bottleneck with the jump gate route. The entire system was only accessible via one lone gate when first discovered. Originally an agricultural colony built by the Аргон to supply food supplies to rest of the Аргон Federation, Поміж Світів has expanded to include more high tech stations and products. It is also home to the 4th Аргон Expeditionary Force, which is still looking for any new gate routes that can be used. </t>
 <t id="1031002">The last great Duke came to this sector and after a few short stazuras being in the system he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Паранід and a strange alien race, now known to be the Хаак. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Паранід Прайм in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow. </t>
 <t id="1031003">This sector is considered to be one of high importance. In ancient times the Emperor's palace in the high mountains of the Паранід Homeworld became so cold the ice would keep away any travellers. The Emperor chose on such occasions to stay at his winter palace in the equatorial region. When the Ксенон nearly destroyed Паранід Прайм's atmosphere, the equatorial region was all but lost. Until recently the Emperor stayed at his palace in the mountains, accessible because of the heat from the Ксенон experiment. In order to keep with tradition he set up a new winter palace in this sector, overlooking a great lake at the foot on the Kar Miat Mountains. In the winter of Паранід Прайм's northern hemisphere, the Emperor usually occupies this sector with his advisory Dukes, keeping the long tradition that was lost for so long.</t>
 <t id="1031004">This system's heavy security is due to its principal export - Jewellery and Maja Snails. The wild and untamed twin planets here are home to a nomadic workforce, famous for their expertise in raising the delicate snails. These shy, reclusive Паранід tend Snail Farms across all known space. The most valuable installations in this system are protected on two sides by artificially constructed asteroid belts.</t>
 <t id="1031005">Despite being the furthest Паранід system from Паранід Прайм the Xaarist Priests run Притулок Проповідника with strict religious fervour and propriety. Their quiet and devoted worker-monks produce exquisite jewellery, inspirational 'Xja' poetry and the very best in automated, semi-intelligent weapons.</t>
 <t id="1031006">Of little use to the Паранід, this system is leased by the Boron who have a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants here. Limited trade between the Паранід and Boron takes place here and relations between the species are amicable. In return for Паранід protection the Boron lend their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Паранід efforts in cyberbiology.</t>
 <t id="1031007">This asteroid scattered system provides much of the organic supplies required by the 'New Boron Colonies'. Many of the ships used in building and servicing the surrounding Boron systems are built here.</t>
 <t id="1031008">This new Boron colony is being constructed with the aid of the Аргон. After heavy losses in the Спліт and Ксенон conflicts the Boron are eager not to confine themselves to one cluster of systems as they have in the past. The foundations of a thriving mining colony have already been completed and stage two is well underway.</t>
 <t id="1031009">This busy Boron mining colony doubles as a refit and supply centre for Boron ships working the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids make the Boron who dwell here harder and more cynical than their compatriots nearer the Boron home systems.</t>
 <t id="1031010">This system is typical of small scale Теладі trading outposts. It produces Теладі speciality goods as well as traditional foodstuffs both for local and export markets. The Теладі merchants here trade mainly with the Boron living in neighbouring space but naturally they welcome any visitor with credit to spare.</t>
 <t id="1031104">Being the first and only Теладі Sector located next to a Паранід Sector, the Теладі opened this sector for massive amounts of trade, but trade with the Паранід was not a sensible decision. Trade was low, and not many Паранід passed these sectors, the odd ship coming in for supplies. The Теладі Chairman for this sector noticed they were slowly going into debt and so pulled out most of the high tech factories. The sector from this point on was dubbed Важкий Борг, and the name stuck since that time. Although relations between the two races are improving, trade is increasing at a minimal rate. Because of this debt the Теладі trade dock is relatively quiet, with cargo bays remaining empty and most market sections closed off and in a state of decay.</t>
 <t id="1031110">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through this system. Subsequently many jazuras of archaeology and recovery was undertaken with the assistance of the Аргон. After the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in, but the jump into the system did not go as planned. On entry, they found themselves in the middle of a pirate ambush. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed. The Пірат have since planted a large minefield in the hope of capturing other ships; travel through this system should be taken with great care.</t>
 <t id="1031202">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031203">This sector contains one half of Сім'я Рай's assets. They use this system as a supply depot to passing Спліт craft. The planet's main colony consists of a large geodesic dome. Inside one can find large amounts of weaponry being sold in armoury markets. Pirate activity in this system is also increased because of the local activity, but the Rhy Family does nothing to stop this. Being on the border of the local Теладі Sectors, Бажання Рай can usually find large numbers of Теладі coming in to trade and purchase these illegal goods.</t>
 <t id="1031204">The pride of the local Теладі sectors is this colony; the high tower of the Міністерство Фінансів stands high on the planets surface. The Ministry was set up to oversee the Company's finances when setting up new sectors, although this wing of the Теладі Company wasn't entirely successful. When the neighbouring system, Важкий Борг, was first opened to the public, the sector ran into trouble and the Ministry was held responsible. The colony skyline is dominated by the 80 story tower that casts a shadow over the gardens of trade, a large garden filled with markets and made more appealing to visiting Аргон and Boron traders. </t>
 <t id="1031210">This sector was worthless to other races, inaccessible by other races because of the minefield in the sector to the north. This sector was originally a boron research sector, and with a handful of stations this colony was a working one. When the colony plans for Спадок ЛуМанкСтрату fell though after a pirate attack this colony had to be abandoned. Some stations were scuttled others were later reactivated by pirate forces who have now laid claim to this system.</t>

 <t id="1031303">The lesser family of Rhy, in the days before space colonisation, spent most of their time on Спліт Prime, using their knowledge of espionage and sabotage to plunder other families resources and claim them as salvage. Rhy moved off-world to their own system when they became a more powerful family, after helping the Сім'я Ронкар in their battle against the old Patriarch. This sector contains half of the family's assets in space trading, including their own carrier. Rhy no longer uses espionage as their main trait, but are now starting to build up their own military. There are also rumours in local bars of a hidden gate in or near to this system.</t>
 <t id="1031310">This rogue sector is on the main trade lane between old sectors and more recent expansions of the Паранід Empire. A small trading post that runs itself independently from other races. It has little or no police, with pirate raiding parties taking the opportunity to seize power in this system. Most ships that come though this sector can be expected to come under some form of attack, and with the Паранід not willing to send in forces to assist ships with the exception of other Паранід traders, there is little chance of official help.</t>
 <t id="1031316">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031401">The RBMD or Royal Boron Military Defence, system 'Глибина Тиші', was formed to build new ships and develop new technologies. This system is heavily guarded in case of attack by Ксенон or other forces hostile to the Boron Navy. The sector is filled with high-tech Boron Stations, including those that specialise in the production of new Boron weapons systems. Entrance to this system is granted if you're carrying cargo to this system, or if you have previous access rights.</t>
 <t id="1031402">This system is rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. If you enter this system there is a great possibility that the local military police force will scan your ship; if you have hostile intentions you will be attacked. It is this tightened security that has led to these rumours. The sector itself is a small trade outpost with little need for high tech goods.</t>
 <t id="1031403">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system is a source of strategic power for the Boron. Being a border colony to the local Спліт Family, this sector also acts as a crossroads for other Boron settlements, making it particularly important for passing trade. It is guarded by a lone destroyer with escorts, pirate activity here is minimal.</t>
 <t id="1031404">This system was originally empty with a few asteroids creating a barrier near the gate, this was until the Boron moved the gate away from the vein of asteroids. Пустельні Береги today has become a thriving trade colony with exports being high. Whether high-tech goods are available at this time is Невідомий.</t>
 <t id="1031409">This sector was formed shortly after the claiming of the sector to the south. Set up originally as a monastery, it provided a place for the passing priests to pray and hold quiet meditation. Military forces were virtually non-existent during early settlement, leaving the monastery open to attack by raiding parties from the nearby Pirate sectors. The Priests held their position in the safety of the temple caverns for several Tazuras before the Паранід managed to get a destroyer in the sector to protect it. The destroyer has now moved to the next sector to prevent such insertions into Паранід territory.</t>
 <t id="1031410">With most of the Паранід now in space-borne colonies, the high priest of the Паранід chose to seek a new Cardinal to set up his religious sections in the new Duchy Systems. This sector is now home to the Cardinal who chose this sector for the capital of the Second Duchy. The system boasts shipyard facilities, and equipment docks, as well as being guarded by a Destroyer ship, mainly for protection from the Пірат from past the north gate.</t>
 <t id="1031411">When the Паранід first entered this system they found an empty sector accessible by two gates, but the planet remains a mystery here. There are a few remnants of a civilization with one relic, - a needle-like object made from stone that stands 3 stories high, in the middle of what may have been a city. At the foot of the monument a large gemstone was found inside a carved stone case. After prolonged surveys it was discovered that there was once a large building here, which was thought to be a temple. Scientists today are still trying to understand what the script on the needle object means.</t>

 <t id="1031503">This sector holds a major settlement recently set up by the Boron, a construction colony based on ship production. The system is named for the nebula that is located nearby. The colony itself has facilities for both families and the military, with municipal recreation domes containing restaurants, water-parks and marinas.</t>
 <t id="1031509">Джерело Віри was originally a Boron sector named &quot;Queen's Paradise&quot;. An accident during a scientific experiment on the planets surface released vast amounts of radiation. Soon after, the local population started to die of a mysterious disease. When it was discovered that the radiation was the cause, the Boron Government ordered an evacuation of the sector. Ксенон fleets also tried to inhabit the sector, but the radiation affected electronic systems onboard their craft. As the radiation grew weaker the Паранід finally settled in this system and claimed it as their own. With the radiation now a minor problem the Boron Government has tried to reclaim the system, but the Паранід Government refuses to give up their tenure.</t>
 <t id="1031510">This sector is occupied by one planet and the remains of its only moon. It is Невідомий how the moon was destroyed in this manner, but the fallout has caused the planet's atmosphere to become irradiated, leaving it deadly to all forms of life. When the Паранід moved in, they set up a standard colony with basic resources. Hopefully in time more will be built.</t>
 <t id="1031511">This is last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors. This sector is famed for its lack of hospitality. It is said to be a retreat for the Pontifex in case he needs to leave the main sectors and be out of contact for one reason or another. As it is deep within the Second Duchy, this sector is hard to reach, - especially with the pirate sectors inhabiting a route into this area. </t>

 <t id="1">[title]Refugee Crisis Imminent! $TRADERANK$ Pilots required![/title]\n\n[justify]A message for all pilots with a clean, good condition $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Time is short, so this communication will be brief. It seems there has been a period of conflict near to $THERESECTOR$ which has caused many races to flee to safer sectors. Most of them are now being held in the $THERE$ but there is a problem. This station is not equipped to handle so many at one time. Whilst they have sufficient Medical Equipment, they are running very low on Food Rations. We really need to get some there soon. The authorities fear that if they do not receive any within $TIMELIMIT$ then the refugees may attempt to storm the station and seize it by force. Therefore a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft is needed to deliver $AMOUNT$ units of Food Rations there within $TIMELIMIT$.\n\nOnce hired, the pilot will be paid $REWARD$ for his troubles and if he gets there fast enough he may get up to $BONUSREWARD$ as well. We are confident there are many pilots here who look up to such a benevolent mission.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="2">Keep going pilot - you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining to deliver the goods</t>
 <t id="3">That's fantastic! You've made it well ahead of schedule. I'm more than impressed with your skills pilot.\n\nHere is your reward. I was going to pay you just $REWARD$ but instead I'm going to give you an additional $BONUSREWARD$ as well on account of the time you've saved and the skills you've shown. Well done! We'll be in touch again I'm sure.</t>
 <t id="4">Pilot, this is $AUTHOR$ from the $HERE$, you procured some $WARES$ from us recently as you may recall. Well, even though you were a good pilot in our books, it looks like you don't have the necessary standing to deliver the $WARES$ to the station. Something appears to have happened that has caused them to deny you docking rights. We're not sure what but it doesn't seem good. I'm afraid we're going to have to take your name off the list of pilots we can trust. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Sorry but the contract has been cancelled.</t>
 <t id="5">Excellent. You qualify for this trading run. Remember that you have $TIMELIMIT$ to get to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. The amount placed aboard your ship is $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. Well don't just stand there, get going!!</t>
 <t id="6">Get lost, can't you read or is your translator broken? You need to be at least $TRADERANK$ or higher to cope with this mission</t>
 <t id="7">You have docked at the $THERE$. You have my gratitude for completing the journey. Here is your payment, $REWARD$ as agreed. </t>
 <t id="8">You have arrived at the $THERE$, late. This is quite unacceptable. Your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. Your skills as a pilot leave much to be desired. </t>
 <t id="9">Pilot, You either have a severe memory problem, or you just don't have a clue how to get there. Time has run out and you aren't even close to the $THERE$. As for the payment of $REWARD$ that I was due to pay you, well that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.</t>
 <t id="10">When did you last check your ship? It's not a $SHIPTYPE$ craft. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="11">I'm sorry, it appears that you do not have the necessary storage space needed for this mission. You need a ship that can maintain at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. You're either incredibly bad at basic Гонер arithmetic, or plain stupid. Your authorisation will be reviewed when you have increased your storage capacity. Until then, either dump some cargo or get a bigger ship.</t>
 <t id="12">I'm sorry but you appear to have had some problems with the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ that prevents you from docking there. We don't know what's been happening in your past, but we don't want to be a part of it. We'll find someone else who can get the wares to where we want them to be shipped. </t>
 <t id="13">Pilot, it appears that you have betrayed our agreement. We specifically requested that you deliver the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Unfortunately you do not seem to have taken this instruction onboard. We have received word from the $THERE$ that they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. The hangar crew have confirmed you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items. Payment for this shipment has been cancelled and your ship id has been passed onto all relevant authorities. Do not think you are going to get away with this, the consequences of your actions will soon begin to make themselves clear. Communication Closed!</t>

 <t id="101">[title]Urgent delivery of Weapon Interface Chips required[/title]\n\n[justify]All pilots of $TRADERANK$ or higher are requested to assist in the shipment of a batch of Weapon Interface Chips that are behind schedule. All cargo ships on this station have currently been impounded following investigations by authorities over a possible payment error to a recent trader. For this reason, we require $AMOUNT$ units of WIC's to be shipped to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ immediately. \n\nAny pilots who are at least a rank of $TRADERANK$ with their own $SHIPTYPE$ craft are requested to ship the cargo to $THERE$ within $TIMELIMIT$. Payment of $REWARD$ will be made on completion of the mission, and up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for swift couriers who make it there sooner. If successful, future work will no doubt be offered in due course.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining and counting. $THERE$ are counting on you, make best speed Pilot!</t>
 <t id="103">You have reached the $THERE$ in good time. Your timekeeping is quite impressive. The payment of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account, but you will also find an extra $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the $REWARD$ originally promised. Job well done!</t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THERESECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the $THERE$ to complete your shipment of the $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been cancelled. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about where you fire your lasers. </t>
 <t id="105">Your information checks out and you have been accepted for hauling this cargo. Note that you only have $TIMELIMIT$ to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$.</t>
 <t id="106">You're ranking is lower than $TRADERANK$ - I wouldn't trust you with delivering the mail, let alone our $WARES$. Go away!</t>
 <t id="107">Excellent. You have reached the $THERE$ on time. Payment of the $REWARD$ as agreed has been made directly to your account. Your mission has been completed. You are free to undertake further contracts or continue about your travels. </t>
 <t id="108">Something tells me that you haven't cleaned the spaceflies out from your engines in a long while. Your experience as a pilot leaves much to be desired, I've seen Argnu with better navigation skills. Your payment has been reviewed and consequently reduced. You will find the sum of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="109">I could have sworn I asked you to get to the $THERE$. What part of that order did you not understand pilot?! There's no point in paying you a single credit, you just don't deserve it seeing as your ship is no where near the destination. The $REWARD$ originally destined for your account will be used to find a pilot who actually knows what he's doing.</t>
 <t id="110">If only I had 10 credits for every time a pilot like you wasted my time. You need a $SHIPTYPE$ craft to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="111">There does not appear to be enough cargo capacity in your ship to hold all of the $WARES$. You need at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units in order to take on this mission. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. Unless you do something to balance the two figures out, you can't undertake this mission! Go sell some cargo or get a larger bay, just don't come back until you've learned how to add and subtract!</t>
 <t id="112">We're not going to be able to use you as a pilot I'm afraid. It looks like the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ doesn't like you as much as you might have thought. We're not sure why, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for a pilot who is worthy of their docking rights. </t>
 <t id="113">I can't believe it! Wasn't the payment of $REWARD$ enough for you? Apparently you took it upon yourself to make some of the $WARES$ we had asked you to ship part of your reward too. This is unacceptable. If the $THERE$ are to be believed, and I have more reason to believe them than I do you, they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ from your ships cargo bay. Back here the cargo inventory systems have confirmed that you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items! We've been doing business with companies in $THERESECTOR$ for longer than you've been flying, this is the first time we've had a Pilot go rogue on us. So, it looks like we're going to have to revoke your payment of $REWARD$ and place you on the list of Pilots who can't keep their word, let alone their cargo!</t>
 <t id="200">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="201">[title]Latest Entertainment Chips ready for Release![/title]\n\n[justify]The latest version of the popular Entertainment Chips are now in full production. Representatives for the distributors are awaiting test stock at $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. There are $AMOUNT$ units to deliver. You will need a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft and rank of at least $TRADERANK$ to do so.\n\nIf you can get them there within $TIMELIMIT$ we will reward you with a payment of $REWARD$. If you can get them there earlier, we can surprise the market with an early release and you could get up to $BONUSREWARD$ extra. Applicants must be aware that disclosure of any information regarding this hardware is strictly prohibited prior to the release.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="202">I've seen faster spaceflies, but unlike them, you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining</t>
 <t id="203">You have reached the $THERE$. Thank you for getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ so quickly. Here is your payment of $REWARD$. We are more than happy to offer you the bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the original payment. You travel light, travel fast, and you do it well. Should some express freight transport be needed in future, you will be on our lists.</t>
 <t id="204">Hey! I don't think you're going to be able to dock at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ anymore to deliver your $WARES$. What in Splits Fire are you doing out there!? The $THERE$ has notified us that they have marked you down for neutralization should you return anywhere near their station. Whatever it is you've done, it looks like we're not going to be able to pay you the $REWARD$  we had reserved for completion of your shipment. Sorry but you're no longer on our list of pilots we'd like to have work for us. Find your haulage contracts elsewhere from now on. </t>
 <t id="205">Ok great, looks like a fast ship to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. $TIMELIMIT$ is a little bit restrictive so you better get a move on.</t>
 <t id="206">Sorry pilot - you need to be $TRADERANK$ or higher to help us with this mission. Come back when you have more experience</t>
 <t id="207">You have arrived at the $THERE$ in good time. I'm happy to pay you the $REWARD$ as per our agreement. Your skills as a pilot are worthy of note. Perhaps you should enlist as a transport pilot full time?</t>
 <t id="208">You have finally docked at the $THERE$. Due to the extreme amount of time taken to reach the station, your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. This sum has already been transferred to your account. It is suggested that you use this money to purchase some sector maps and perhaps a few extra engine tunings. It looks like you need them. </t>
 <t id="209">You are quite incredible, you seem to know how to dock at every single station apart from the $THERE$ where you were actually asked you to go! Your payment of $REWARD$ is staying in my account, you won't be getting any of it!</t>
 <t id="210">I said only $SHIPTYPE$ class craft would be good enough for this mission, can't you read?</t>
 <t id="211">Your ship is not equipped with the necessary cargo space in order to complete this mission. The shipment requires a minimum of $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. It appears that you have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$. I do not think I need to continue any further. Please obtain the correct level of storage space before attempting to gain authorization for this mission. </t>
 <t id="212">We'd like to be able to take you on as our pilot, but it seems the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ have other plans in mind. They consider you a threat to their station. Thanks for the interest though. We'll be sure to be in touch when your reputation has improved. </t>
 <t id="213">Attention, we have just received word from the $THERE$ that you have not delivered all of the $WARES$ that we loaded onto your ship. Is there a problem Pilot? We specifically agreed on a payment of $REWARD$ for the shipment of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$. It seems that from this original agreement, you have taken it upon yourself to only ship $PLAYERSAMOUNT$, so where are the rest of the units? This is not something we consider to be either funny or conducive to a good business partnership. Your ship id has been registered with the authorities. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Do not think this will do your standing in the local sectors any good at all Pilot. </t>
 <t id="300">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="301">[title]Nebulae Gas Causes Damage To Station!! Help!!![/title]\n\n[justify]News of an incident at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ involving a long-distance freighter has just been received. A discharge of nebulae gas into station electronics by the vessel has meant that many of the cartography systems have sustained irreparable damage. Cartography Chips are now urgently required in order that correct navigation and course mapping be continued. Pilots who have control of $SHIPTYPE$ class craft are asked to assist in the shipment of the Cartographic Hardware. Your trade rank must be at least $TRADERANK$. The greater experience you have however, the more successful you will be. With no spare Cartography Chips available, it has been confirmed that $AMOUNT$ chips from this station $HERE$ are to be couriered to $THERE$ in order that all systems remain operational.\n\nAs advised, pilots will require a $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Shipment of the cargo within $TIMELIMIT$ is your priority task. You will receive payment of $REWARD$ on completion and installation of the goods. Couriers able to reach the destination earlier will receive up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for their skill and precision. Please contact Station authorities on acceptance of this mission. Goods will be loaded onto your ship immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="302">Keep it steady pilot, don't forget the $REWARD$ waiting for you if you complete the delivery within the next $TIMELEFT$</t>
 <t id="303">You've managed to make good time, thanks for making the effort in getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ on time. The bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ is yours!! And of course the initial $REWARD$. Thanks for the help.</t>
 <t id="304">Pilot, mission is aborted! We've just received comms from the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. It appears that they have revoked all docking privileges for your ship as well as your id. They have asked us to notify you that you can take the $WARES$ you were due to ship to them and shove them up your plasma ducts. We're not too sure what it is you've been doing out there, but the payment of $REWARD$ is no longer available to you. The contract has been cancelled. Find someone else to play your games with. </t>
 <t id="305">Hmm well everything appears to check out. The $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ are on board. $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ are expecting you in $TIMELIMIT$ or less. Good Journey Pilot!!</t>

 <t id="40003">$WARES$ transported to the $THERE$ on time. Payment, to the sum of $REWARD$ has been made as promised, also we have put the $BONUSREWARD$ in as well. With your abilities I hope you do more missions for us of this nature in the future.</t>
 <t id="40004">Haha, I'm thinking you aren't all that wise. Why? because you had your TP class ship with passengers that saw everything you did to upset the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. One of them contacted me and sent me photographs over a secure channel. Mission Over!</t>
 <t id="40005">Ok your TP class ship has passed our safety inspections, $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ are waiting for the $WARES$ so if you make good time the extra $BONUSREWARD$ will be yours.</t>
 <t id="40007">You arrived with time to spare Pilot, excellent. Here's the $REWARD$ for the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ you dropped off.</t>
 <t id="40008">Well, arriving late isn't quite the start I had hoped for pilot! You either don't know your way around the sectors, or you were taking me for a fool. Here's your payment, well part of it, $REWARD$, no more, no less. If you think you deserve more than that, you're kidding yourself. I'd like to say it's been a pleasure doing business with you, but it hasn't!</t>
 <t id="40009">What have you been doing? I expected $WARES$ to be at $THERE$ IN $THERESECTOR$ by now. I strongly suggest that you take them to the nearest Station now! I will organize more reliable transport from there. Don't ask for payment as I don't think you have earned it.</t>
 <t id="40011">Ok, come on Pilot. I couldn't get any more people onto your ship if you ripped out all the seats, stop wasting my time.</t>
 <t id="40013">I have had reports that you have ejected the $WARES$ into space. This is very bad. I do hope this was some kind of accident. If this isn't the case you shall be reported to the authorities and hunted down like the murderer you are.</t>
 <t id="40014">Thanks at least for getting the $WARES$ there. Even if its not to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$.</t>

A military transport vessel has been redirected to another sector due to unforeseen hostilities. $AMOUNT$ combat veterans need urgent transport from this $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Group Commanders will not accept any level of pilot, or ship. Pilots must have a $SHIPTYPE$ class vessel, along with adequate combat and piloting experience. The deadline for reaching the $THERE$ is $TIMELIMIT$, you have to be at least $TRADERANK$ as well as being of trusted origin, fail to make that deadline and your payment of $REWARD$ will either be revoked or severely reduced. If however pilots have craft able to reach the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ quite a bit earlier, the Group Commander will ensure payment of additional funds unto a maximum of $BONUSREWARD$ . Those who consider themselves worthy, report to the hangar bay immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="40102">You are on a schedule here. You have $TIMELEFT$ left before your reward will be either reduced or revoked. Get to $THERE$ in time. </t>

 <t id="40104">Something you did recently has the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ really angry, I've been talking to them, and they aren't going to let you onto their station. Please drop off the $WARES$ to a station that you can dock with, so I can get them picked up.</t>
 <t id="40105">Far out Pilot, how do you keep your ship in such a mess? The $WARES$ need to be $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ soon, so they have no choice but take the trip with you. Remember $TIMELIMIT$ ok?</t>
 <t id="40107">You were cutting it close, I hope that none of the $WARES$ were getting too restless. Here's the agreed $REWARD$.</t>
 <t id="40108">There you are...finally. I was getting worried sick for the $WARES$. You are late, at least you arrived I suppose. I'm reducing the payment to $REWARD$, be thankful you got that much.</t>
 <t id="40109">Have you been flying in circles? I could have walked to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ by now, drop the $WARES$ off at the next station. I am very disappointed with your service. If you want payment you will be in for a long wait! Now get them to a station, now!</t>
 <t id="40111">I'm just wondering, where would I put them if I gave this job to you? You have no space Pilot. </t>
 <t id="40113">Pilot? What just happened? Has there been a hull breach? We appear to have lost some of the life signs from your passengers. This is unacceptable. The incident will be reported to the authorities immediately. Do not think this little incident will not go against your record. Next time you travel by TP as a passenger yourself, I suggest you wear a spacesuit, you may need it. </t>
 <t id="40114">Thank God, I was worried the $WARES$ were never going to get off of your damn ship. Good bye and good riddance.</t>
 <t id="40203">Ok how did you do that? $TIMELEFT$ and you are here already! Alright here's the extra $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the $REWARD$, you have earned it.</t>
 <t id="40204">What's going on Pilot? I've got reports that you are doing bad things for your reputation with $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. They will no longer allow you to dock with their station!. Well all you can do is drop the $WARES$ to another station, that way I can get someone to pick them up. I hope not all pilots are like you.</t>
 <t id="40205">Awesome, now move it if you want to be in $THERESECTOR$ in $TIMELIMIT$. $THERE$ are waiting for the $WARES$, so please hurry.</t>
 <t id="40207">Seems that the $WARES$ were in for quite a ride, they are saying that you had refreshments for them for the trip, good job Pilot, here's the $REWARD$ we agreed on.</t>
 <t id="40208">I've heard the $WARES$ are quite stressed, and no wonder. They must have been wondering if you were ever going to drop them off at $THERE$ at all. $REWARD$ is all you are getting, now get in your ship and go somewhere else.</t>
 <t id="40209">Excuse me, shouldn't you have got the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ by now? I would like them to be dropped off at the next Station, so I can organize faster onward travel. As you have not completed your part of the bargain I will retain the fee.</t>
 <t id="40211">Seems your ship is pretty much full, I'm sorry but people actually need space to move around. I will wait for someone else to accept this offer</t>

We need to retrieve them from your ship in order to pass them on to a more competent pilot. Please drop the $WARES$ off at the next station you dock with!</t>
 <t id="40414">$AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. Thank you for docking. You may proceed to Hangar Bay IV for maintenance or depart at your discretion.</t>
 <t id="40509">I'm afraid the time given to deliver the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ is over. You are by far the worst pilot we have had the misfortune of employing. Why didn't you tell us you didn't know how to fly!? Please drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station in order for us to pass them over to a more competent pilot. </t>

Drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station, we may be able to get some close to your position to pick them up. You're on your own now, forget any payment you were hoping to receive. You're not worthy of the $REWARD$ we offered. Mission aborted. </t>

Pilots who can make it there in time will be paid $REWARD$, those able to make it there a lot faster than the $TIMELIMIT$ may get the additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="60008">You fly like a Гонер Priest. When I accepted you as the transport pilot for the $WARES$, I was either under the influence of spacefuel, or just under the impression that you actually knew how to fly. Still, you made it to the $THERE$, how I do not know, so I'm going to pay you $REWARD$ for your trouble. If you think I'm going to give you this kind of mission again, you're going to be waiting a long long time. Go back flight school pilot, you have a long way to go before you can call yourself competent!</t>

My name is $AUTHOR$ of the $ARACEN$. Thirty Jazura's ago, a $VRACEN$ pirate landed on this station amidst the celebrations at the birth of our little princess. Under our very noses he stole her away to be sold for means we have never yet made clear. Despite many searches, our hopes slowly faded as first the mazuras, then jazuras went by. We know now that she will never come back to us. Our hearts still hold vengeance and injustice against this pirate who must be dealt with.\n\nWe see you to be of good character and spirit, all we ask is that you have a fast ship and good weaponry. Spies employed by this station have tracked down the $VRACEN$ mercenary to $VSECST$. He is currently heading to the sector of $VSECFN$. I will happily pay you the sum of $REWARD$ credits if you travel there immediately and show him that we have never forgotten, nor forgiven.$ENDOFF$[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='start']Contact $AUTHOR$[/select][/center][/text]</t>

I am Commander $AUTHOR$. We are in the process of locating an individual who has been working under our authority as an intermediary between ourselves and various Pirate clans in an effort to cease hostilities. Unfortunately this individual, of $VRACEN$ origin, whom we have confirmed to hold an alias of $VICTIM$, has recently taken it upon himself to return to his home sector of $VSECFN$ along with several thousand terabytes of classified data we currently hold of Pirate clandestine operations. The disclosure of this material to the Pirate home sectors would no doubt cause an immediate rise in hostilities, something we cannot afford at this time due to our myriad enemies making inroads into all sectors that we consider to be of strategic importance.\n\nWe have been able to track $VICTIM$ for the past mizura; he was last seen flying out of a station in $VSECST$. We are expecting him to reach $VSECFN$ as an end-point in his journey at which time he will transfer the data by courier to another source we have not yet been able to identify. This must be avoided at all costs. We have been authorised to offer you $REWARD$ credits in order to terminate this individual. Please confirm your acceptance or rejection of this offer. Should you decline, you will be ordered to undertake a retinal scan and placed under surveillance in order that any information given to you here is not leaked.[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='start']Contact $AUTHOR$[/select][/center][/text]</t>
 <t id="4003">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][text cols='1'][justify]Congratulations on a job well done. You have exceeded our expectations in all respects.

Their leader, $VICTIM$, has threatened to kill her if I notify Police forces, or do not surrender a sum of 25,000,000 credits to them. All I have is this one factory, I barely make enough to keep our transports active, I fear that when they hear I neither have the money or ability to pay, they will dispose of her without thought.

If you can neutralise him, I will be able to make contact with her and use this station's defence force to deal with any threat on the station.

The pay is slow and the job's steady but it's all I have right now. I need escort from here to the $TargetStation$ in $TargetSector$. You'll be paid $Credits$ Credits just as soon as my goods have left my cargo bay and I've received my profits.\n\n[select value='go']Contact $Author$[/select][/center][/text]</t>
 <t id="301">[text cols=&quot;2&quot;][center]We require an experienced Pilot with a well-armed ship to accompany our Art Treasures on the next leg of our universe wide tour.\nThe successful pilot must be honest and reliable and must protect our Treasures at all costs. It would be a catastrophe if these priceless Treasures where lost or damaged as they represent some of the best and rare items that range from ancient Спліт tapestries to item reputed to have belong to the Гонер hero Nathan R Gunne.\nThe next leg of the tour is to $TargetStation$ in $TargetSector$ and the current fee available to the successful pilot is $Credits$ credits.\nIf interested please contact $Author$\n\n[select value='go']Contact Advertiser[/select][/center][/text]</t>
 <t id="303">Excellent, our Treasures have arrived in one piece ready to be shown to an interested public. Here is the Fee of $Credits$ credits that was agreed. Thank you again!</t>
 <t id="304">Such a loss! All those Treasures lost forever! You have failed the universe; your name shall be infamous in the Art World. I will make sure you never work again!</t>
 <t id="305">Marvellous, You seem like just the person we were after. Our transport ship will follow you out. The ship's ID is $EscortID$. Remember it is essential that no harm comes to our transporter or its valuable contents.</t>
 <t id="306">What? Idiots! Some fool of a station Controller has reallocated our Transporter to another customer and to cap it all a replacement is not available. Sorry we will have to wait till another ship is prepared.</t>
 <t id="307">You don't look very trustworthy to me, I think there are pilots out there better qualified than you.</t>
 <t id="308">I must admit that you don't look stupid, but then looks can be deceiving. How can you protect our Treasures with no weapons? Go away and stop wasting my time!</t>
 <t id="309">That's great, I've paid the $Credits$, but I suggest you get as far as way as possible, this station may not be here much longer!</t>
 <t id="310">Excellent, our Treasures have arrived in one piece ready to be shown to an interested public. Here is the Fee of $Credits$ credits that was agreed. Thank you again!</t>
 <t id="311">Please wait here, I'll just going to dock the Transporter.</t>
 <t id="312">I think it would be a good idea for you to leave this station and get as far away as possible. Don't dawdle as you might loose more than you think!</t>

I must say Elena is quite impressed, - and knowing her business acumen, she is far from easy to impress. While we both know that there is more than a little of your father's sector-jumping spirit in you, we still feel it would be wise for you to take the time to build up a decent foundation in terms of both factories you own, as well as credits freely available to you.\n\nI know you're on your way to the Паранід sectors to meet Bret, but you should still use this time you have now wisely, trade and expand your horizons beyond the here and now. There may be events and trials beyond what you may see immediately ahead of you, you must be prepared. You need to ensure your ship is as ready for the unforeseen as you are. Bret will be waiting once you have added a few credits and perhaps a few factories and ship upgrades to your name, if anything he has almost as much of a traders eye as you do so you can bet he'll be trading too, though knowing Bret, perhaps not in the same line of wares![/text]</t>

Elena has been in touch with me again, she has asked me that I strongly recommend to you that now would be the perfect time to consolidate your position and business. She has been more than impressed with your performance so far - but she still feels it would be wise for you to take some time to build up a decent base of both factories and ships that you own, as well as credits freely available to you. Use this time you have now wisely, trade and expand your credit balance as far as possible. As I've said many times before, there can and will be times when you will be thankful for the extra resources you have accumulated. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nWhile Mik Balser has confirmed that you are to return to Аргон Prime to meet with me, I must point out there is no immediate need for you to return as I am currently engaged in further research on the data from the AP Gunner's ship computer.

 <t id="172230005">[author]Bret Serra[/author][text colwidth='500']Hey Julian! It's Bret! Been looking at your ship, great work man! Looks like you still know how to make those credits! There may be something that you might want to take a look at though. It's a Strafe Drive extension! You know since I had mine installed, can't live without it. Absolutely essential when you're under attack and can't shake laserfire from your rear. You can get them from Boron, Паранід and Спліт equipment docks I think. The upgrade allows you to move sideways as well as forward at the same time. If you're going to go through the Ксенон sectors with Saya, - you really need to get the Strafe Drive plugged into your ships systems. Without it you'll be a sitting duck, and I'm not going to be sitting on your rear waiting to rescue your sorry behind if you eject! Anyway, that's all Jules. Catch you on the other side of the Ксенон sectors. Keep an eye on Saya for me, she's too cocky for her own good![/text]</t>

Is there something wrong with your weaponry? I must ask you to return at best speed, we are at a critical point in our battle with the Хаак in this sector, we cannot afford to be without your skill both as a pilot and combat veteran. Our forces urgently need your guidance in dealing with one of the Хаак motherships that is threatening our fleet. Saya and Bret are doing their best to work with our Force Commanders, but there are several waves that have advanced formation and evasion tactics that you have proven to be able to counteract - in particular when you jumped to the Хаак sector recently. While you do not have the pleasure of flying the Hydra at this time, you still have the experience that we so desperately need. We can but hope that your presence will push the tide in our favour. Godspeed Julian, in this, our darkest stazura, we will either stand or fall. Make your way back to us while there is still time...[/text]</t>

I believe that you may still be unaware of the consequences of your inability to follow clear and specific orders from Cmdr Danna. We had hoped to make a stand against the Хаак at Omicron, send them a clear signal that we were not a race who would lay down or accept their invasion without question. In that respect, we have failed. Several mizuras ago we lost all contact with our forces in Омікрон Ліри. Scout vessels were sent in to establish the current status of our fleet. We have lost, Mr Gardna. We have lost everything.\n\nOn behalf of Аргон Command I regretfully inform you that Commander Danna, your father Kyle Brennan, Bret Serra, Saya Kho and all forces operating in the sector have been wiped out. In addition to this, the lives of 80 million people, an entire sectors population, have been lost in the destruction of Омікрон Ліри's home planet. There is nothing left but battle debris.\n\nWhile this loss cannot be placed directly on your shoulders, we feel that your inaction had left little chance for the forces in Omicron to make any level of coordinated effort in repelling the Хаак or rescuing Kyle Brennan. The ghosts of many people, good people, will remain with us in the wake of this immeasurable loss. May you remember them well.[/text]</t>

You must be able to hold $TKCLASS$ type goods to take this mission..[br/] We will pay you $UNITPRICE$ for each unit that you can supply.

 <t id="2">Keep going pilot-you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining to deliver the goods</t>
 <t id="3">That's great! You've managed to get all of the $WARES$ that we asked you to deliver to us here at the $HERE$. We're quite impressed with your ability to haul cargo on a deadline. For the $AMOUNT$ units you returned to us you have received a total of $REWARDSOFAR$. Here's the additional $BONUSREWARD$ as per our agreement, as well as keep your name on our lists for future work. Thanks for your help, see you in $THISSECTOR$ soon!</t>
 <t id="4">Well, even though you were a good pilot in our books, it looks like you don't have the necessary standing to deliver the $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ to the station. I'm afraid we're going to have to take your name off the list of pilots we can use. Sorry but the contract has been cancelled. </t>
 <t id="5">Okay, it looks like you have been authorized to proceed with this mission.

You will have these details retained in your ships log, so if you ever need to remind yourself, the details will be there. I'm going to start you off with a few suggestions on where you may find some $WARES$. Actually there's quite a few, here's some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="6">When did you last check your ship? You need at least freight size $TKCLASS$ to accept this mission. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="7">Excellent! You've brought back some $WARES$ to our $HERE$. The total you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship up to now. Remember that there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to obtain more of the goods we require. </t>
 <t id="8">I see that you've been having some problems... Haven't found any of the wares we require yet? Well, you still have $TIMELEFT$ to get us the full amount of $WARES$. If you manage to get them all, we will be happy to supply you with the extra payment of $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="9">Well it looks like you're out of time! We can't accept any more wares from you. You managed to ship a total of $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ to us! Your total payment for what you delivered to us was $REWARDSOFAR$. Thanks for helping us out pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="10">Well, that's something we've never seen before. You've actually managed to get none of the $WARES$ that we asked you to ship back to our $HERE$. You have to be one of the worst haulage pilots we have ever employed. I'm sorry but since you didn't provide us with anything, we're not willing to provide you with any payment. Seems that the promise of $BONUSREWARD$ on getting all the $WARES$ didn't effect your motivation one little bit. Go Away, I'm telling all the factories around here how bad you are!!</t>

 <t id="101">[Title]Factory Failure Creates Opening for Additional Trade Run[/title]\n\n[justify]Greetings to all. One of our main competitors has been hit by disaster as all its transport pilots have suddenly taken industrial action and walked out on strike. Being low on resources, they will be unable to supply all their customers, who will be forced to come to us. So here at the $HERE$ we need to quickly build up our stocks and to do so we need at least another $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. However all our own pilots are busy, which means we have an opening for a pilot. The applicant for this mission has only $TIMELIMIT$ to get all $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ back to us here. In return we will reimburse $UNITPRICE$ per unit, in addition to that the willing pilot must be in a ship that can take $TKCLASS$ sized cargo and hold at least a standing of $TRADERANK$. We are working on a tight schedule as we have made clear, so if all the $WARES$ are delivered within $TIMELIMIT$ then up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ will be paid.[/justify] </t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining. We're counting on you to get the $WARES$ to us so please don't let us down.</t>
 <t id="103">What!? Are you done already? It seems that we now have all of the $WARES$ that we requested to be shipped to this $HERE$. Good work! You were quick to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. Total standard payment you got for all the wares was $REWARDSOFAR$. We are more than happy to pay you the $BONUSREWARD$ that was promised on top, both payments have now been transferred. If you ever need more work in $THISSECTOR$, you know where to find us. </t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THISSECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the station to complete your shipment of the $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about your actions. </t>
 <t id="105">Great, we have your details confirmed as a registered pilot we can trust, so you have the green light on this mission. Here's a heads-up on the mission again. We need a total of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ delivered to the $HERE$ located in $THISSECTOR$. $UNITPRICE$ is what you will get per ware taken from your ship. You need to ship the last batch of cargo to us in less than $TIMELIMIT$. $BONUSREWARD$ on delivery of all goods. As for suggestions on where to go? I'm surprised you've asked, considering you have a ranking as high as $TRADERANK$. Anyway, there are quite a few stations you could go to for $WARES$. Here are some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="106">Get lost - can't you read or is your translator broken? Your ship needs to be able to carry $TKCLASS$ freight at least to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="107">Great work pilot! We now have some $WARES$ in our hangar bay. The amount you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship to us up to now. Just to remind you, there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to get more of the goods we need back to our $HERE$. </t>
 <t id="108">Well it looks like you haven't been able to get any of the wares we need yet. Is there a problem with your navigation software? Well you still have $TIMELEFT$ to bring us the full amount of $WARES$. Remember if you are able to get them all, we will be able to pay you an additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="109">I'm sorry but it appears that the deadline for shipping wares to our $HERE$ has ended. You have clocked up a total of $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ we received. Thanks for all your help pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="110">I don't believe it, you couldn't even get one shipment of $WARES$ back to our $HERE$. What were you doing? Catching spaceflies? Next time we urgently need resources to continue production, we'll hire someone who knows what they're doing. We'll be promising the sum of $BONUSREWARD$ for that pilot to complete the shipments instead. As for you, perhaps you ought to take up another line of work, ferrying passengers for example, if you can get there on time..</t>

There was an engine plasma venting incident recently in the docking area. Unfortunately the transporters cargo bay doors were open at the time. This is a common mistake made by many new transporter pilots. Sadly, the hold was full of our normal supply of $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ and they have become contaminated. We urgently need a new supply if we are to maintain production. The mission is simple. Make sure your ship can carry $TKCLASS$ freight or higher, fly out and deliver back to us within $TIMELIMIT$ the replacement $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. In return for this favour, we will pay a fixed rate $UNITPRICE$ per unit delivered. Get as many as you can.

 <t id="1">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galaxy Wide Martial Arts Tournament Concludes[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The final bout of the no holes barred IGF tournament ended today at 5.45am SGT with the defeat of Аргон 'Ta Shee-Do' grandmaster Nathan Gunner by Shin Zein, the current Спліт 'Pinja' champion after an epic two and a half hour match that left many of the spectators in awe. &quot;It was incredible&quot; said Ta Shee-Do enthusiast Michael Kormach, &quot;Most of the time it was just two blurs going at it in the centre but despite the fact that I was tired, hungry, and desperately needed to relieve myself I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ring. Just crazy.&quot;\n\nThe controversial competition, which has been running for five jazuras now, pits a maximum of two fighters per race against each other in a series of sudden death rounds until a Galactic Champion and Runner Up are determined. Winner is determined by knockout or submission and the final cash prize is substantial. Shin Zein was not available for comment but we were able to speak to a spokesperson for Nathan who claimed, &quot;I have talked to Mr Gunner this morning - he is in good spirits and expects to resume training for the next tournament as soon as he is able to. This is provided that the spine reconstruction surgery goes as planned.&quot; he added.\n\nSpec Harley - Sports Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>

A route is chosen to pass through a number of planetary sectors, normally pirate-free. Пірат even keep clear of the race as it draws too much attention to their activities.\n\nSolar sailing, once popular in early space travel is now the sport of Kings and Governments.

Apart from the distances involved, the goods themselves are increasingly at greater risk from Пірат who are rumoured to be hired by rival factory owners to attack transport ships. Ships that do get through however, bring large profits to their owners. It may be worth investing in some support craft, or purchasing additional weaponry. The profits you gain in success will more than pay for such small investments.\n\nNili Ma - Galaxy Network - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="6">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]&quot;What's With These Пірат?; Miner shows 'concern'&quot;[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Take a &quot;space-walk&quot; in any ship and you're bound to come across space Пірат . They fly around as if their activity is legit- slowly and conspicuously. Such bold activity should make anyone wonder why and how they could do such with &quot;all&quot; the police and government around, which in-turn makes them think of how much police and government vehicles are actually in use.\n\nA miner who just came from a days shift in asteroid-laden, and also home to a pirate base, Ore-Belt questioned an officer as to why there is the base around yet no assaults against it. The officer was &quot;too busy&quot; attending to the shiny new hull of his M6 in his dreams to answer the question. The miner, frustrated at such a lax attitude for the harsh terrain of space made sure he was up by sending a sound pulse to his ship via a squash mine. The miner was spared from imprisonment as he hadn't harmed him, but now he's been put on surveillance for any dangerous activity.\n\nPil Mino - Galaxy Network[/justify][/text]</t>

After checking the Navcharts the Captain noticed he was on a collision course with the South Gate in Пагорб Аладни. The navigator's quarters were later searched and two bottles of Аргон whisky was found along with some spaceweed.\n\nIt is said the Navigator, an ex Гонер, had spiritual conflicts. &quot;He will be placed in hospital for rehabilitation as soon as we dock at the shipyard,&quot; said the Captain.\n\nJanit Brena - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="8">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Phased Shockwave Generator[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Phased Shockwave Generator&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon was developed by a rare alliance between the Теладі and Паранід. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave. This weapon has many uses; one is missile defence, and another is multiple fighter defence. The weapon is quite unique in that it is the first 'area affect' weapon to come out on the open market. The Паранід decided to sell this in attempt to boost their poor economy, and it has proven quite a success since its release. The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires special machinery.\n\nSafety is also an issue; the prototype station exploded when the main matter-compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has been adapted with machines taking over most of the dangerous phases of production. The Phased packages are developed in a vacuum at zero gravity. If the package reacts with photon energy - more commonly known as light - the package will start to expand. Another requirement therefore is a that the manufacturing process takes place entirely in the dark.\n\nThe energy is then compressed using subspace compression technology, similar to that used within cargo bays. When it expands the energy sends out phased waves that affect both the shields and hull of a vessel. Some pilots have described its effects as, 'Being stuck in an Ion Storm'.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="9">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Ion Disruptor[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Ion Disruptor&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nDeveloped by Boron Scientists this weapon is unlike any weapon encountered. The Ion Disruptor fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. The stream is then ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, whilst leaving the hull relatively untouched.\n\nAlthough this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps to high Boron standards. Although simple enough to explain how it works, manufacturing the weapon is different matter. It is a complicated process that involves building a device that can create a stream of ionised particles. This in itself is dangerous. The process can be seen in one of the Borons Published Documents by Dr Halilo Wo - &quot;Processes and Functions of the Ion&quot;[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="10">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - The Mass Driver[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;The Mass Driver&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi-barrelled cannon that is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.\n\nIt inflicts damage not due to the power of individual projectiles but through the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the nature of this weapons ammunition it has almost no effect on a ships shield but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain because all energy requirements are supplied by the ammunition.\n\nCurrently the weapon can only be fitted to Аргон and Спліт ships. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself, a small armour piercing shell with a micro explosive core encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered. This is possible by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy, and an explosive micro-charge designed to propel the shell at high velocity towards its target. This pack contains 200 rounds.[/justify][/text]</t>

Police forces were driven back by over 13,000 protestors as the scene developed into chaos.\n\nThe protestors later took over the police station and held the police forces captive in their own interrogation cells. Emperor Xaar gave orders to send in the 191st Паранід Army Division to quell the angry mob. Camera teams were forced out of the area as the army brought order back to the area. They have been no official reports of casualties and information of exactly how the situation is still Невідомий and probably always will be.\n\nJanit Brano - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Photon Pulse Cannons[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Photon Pulse Cannons&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nFirst Developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Аргон, the Photon Pulse Cannon is a firm favourite of the Аргон Military, who then sold the original designs on to other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. The more powerful version of this weapon include a super-conducting coilset and a proton filter that makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields.\n\nThe stations that produce them were the original Weapons Research Laboratories that developed this technology for the Аргон. Professor Bydnah still works on updating the PPC weapon and has recently become the head of Аргон Weapons Research in Омікрон Ліри, representing the Grand Sonra University.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="13">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Thousands dead as asteroid pushed into planet[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The planet Oceania in Рай Менелаї is in a state of shock after an asteroid hit by a TL class transporter was sent tumbling into the planet's atmosphere. The death toll is currently Невідомий but is thought to number well over 12,000. The gigantic transporter was attempting to set up a silicon mine on a nearby asteroid and nudged the mountain sized rock onto a collision course. The Boron pilot, Fumi No, was tested for narcotics and was found to be under the influence of both spaceweed and Аргон whisky. If found guilty of flying while intoxicated, Fumi No faces a prison sentence of no less than 8 Jazura and his Master's licence revoked. Critics have protested that the length of sentence available is not severe enough compared to the destruction and loss of life caused.\n\nAid convoys are being sent by the Аргон, Гонер and other Boron sectors. The Boron government has set up a charity for all affected and all Boron government factories have sent a percentage of their profits to help. Anyone worried about family members who may have been on the planet at the time are advised to contact the administrator of the nearest Boron trading station for details on the latest updates.\n\nThere will be a memorial service held in the Гонер Temple in Південно-Західна Хмарна База.

 <t id="14">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Competing pirate groups cause havoc in frontier sectors[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Reports have been coming in about rival pirate groups setting up competitions between themselves. The recent spate of thefts, ship hijackings, and smuggling incidents have led to major police investigations which have revealed that the pirate groups are ranking themselves in a league table format. This league table seems to be Спліт into two sections. The first of these sections involves speed records for various activities including the top times for completing gate races, quickest ship hijacking and fastest escape from police attention. The other section relates to the amount of credits gained from certain activities. Examples include the highest price for a single smuggling run of contraband products or the highest price for the sale of a stolen ship.\n\nA copy of the &quot;high credits&quot; section of the leader board was recently obtained by Аргон military forces in a raid on the pirate base in the sector Пояс Руди. The list was a major find and has been used in bringing over 20 Пірат to justice. More of the criminals are still being hunted but the Аргон are confident that when they are found, the criminals will be convicted by the compelling evidence against them. Tomes Burnett, a spokesperson for the Аргон military said &quot;These criminals must be stopped. Not only are they breaking the law, they are making a game out of it. It is a blatant insult to law enforcers of every race as well as to all law abiding citizens throughout the known systems. This cannot and will not be tolerated.&quot; He then went on to remind all individuals that financial rewards are offered to any sentient being who helps to reduce the pirate problem, provided that they are in possession of a police licence.\n\nKunklu Ni - Legal Correspondent, Galnet News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="15">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Particle Accelerator Cannon[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Particle Accelerator Cannon&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon is usually found on larger fighter craft, destroyers and on some battleships and carriers.\nThey have been around since the Аргон Weapons Society was founded near the beginning of the Ксенон conflict. The first of it's class were developed when the Паранід and Аргон were friends and both governments were focused on developing a weapon more powerful than those they currently had in service.\n\nA particle accelerator was entered into the standard laser to try to increase the speed of the weapon's output. The results were amazing an almost 200% increase in output. The PAC was born. The particles are accelerated to two thirds the speed of light. At that point they are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse.\n\nThe effect can be quite devastating, especially to a target ship's hull. A direct hit has been known to actually dent hull plating.\nOver the jazuras, the PAC has evolved into three types, the альфа, бета and гамма. Each one has a slight modification to the polarisation and focusing of the particles.[/justify][/text]</t>

The dangerous game involves an agreement on the award and then the station to land on. The Аргон are believed to just like the rush of the race, the Теладі just like the gambling for credits and the Спліт like the danger and being able to embarrass the loser.\n\nNo casualties in the Теладі and Спліт sectors yet but in Аргон space there have been many deaths when station doors have not opened quickly enough for the ship. New laws are being discussed by all three races to keep the space around stations free from these daredevils.\n\nOmon Misar - Culture Correspondent - GalNet News[/justify][/text]</t>

The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many jazuras of research and development until it could be placed on the open market.\nA major drawback of earlier models being when the weapon was fired a large buildup of plasma remained in the weapons main firing zone. When firing a second time this plasma would ignite causing a large fireball, destroying the craft it was on.\n\nThis was originally resolved by adding a plasma sink into the weapons main design, purging the weapon of all excess plasma between shots. This technology was developed by a now famous Паранід Scientist, LarkElSung, however it has since been made obsolete.\nIn 420 an alternative was added to this weapon to replace the plasma sink, a Boron biological plasma filter. The regenerative properties of the Boron technology means that this filter never needs replacing.\n\nToday HEPT's as they are now known, are invaluable. They can only be used on larger fighters. Any M3 fitted with any of the derivatives of the HEPT is indeed a very powerful craft. As with all technology, new weapons are coming out all the time, who knows one day the HEPT could look like a Спліт child's toy.[/justify][/text]</t>

No one actually knows by whom or when the weapon was first developed. The IRE, as they are better known, are mainly used on scout class M5 craft.

The idea is only at the proposal stage and is sure to encounter many difficulties, not least where to find a neutral venue at which to hold such a conference. However, the notion has the backing of the Boron, Аргон and the Goners. It has even gained the support of one noted Паранід archaeologist, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit.\n\nHowever, an official response to the idea from the Паранід Imperial Antiquities Section has not yet been received. The Теладі Profit Guild has an extensive ancient artefacts programme but this seems more dedicated to selling such items rather than studying them. Спліт find archaeology almost incomprehensible and they have but a few isolated experts. Speaking out, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit said: &quot;I have petitioned the Priest-Dukes on this matter and I feel sure they will acknowledge the wisdom of sharing knowledge of the past. Naturally I must be bound by their interpretation of the sacred texts and so while I support the idea I cannot yet say if I will be there.&quot;\n\nLeading proponent of the idea, Professor Daka Ro of the Royal Boron Archaeological Survey said: &quot;scholar of Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit's calibre could not attend the conference.

 <t id="36">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Concerns Over Security At Weapons Facilities[/title][text cols='2'][justify]With the wide dispersal of weapons and shielding factories throughout the known universe, concern is growing that security may be overstretched. Most governments have allowed private corporations to take responsibility for the production of beam weapons and missile technology. Even some of the new weaponry developments are being put into production in relatively widespread sectors. While all such facilities have their own security forces, there is a real danger that opportunistic raiders could attack in force and seize large quantities of very powerful missiles and energy cannons.\n\nWhile governments are unhappy at the situation, most say there is no alternative to dispersed production if efficient distribution of weapons is to be maintained. They also point to the need to ensure resources for their factories are within easy reach. Теладі Profit Guild official Etofomeos Ilalios Ulylues VIII said: &quot;There is a need to balance practicality with security. Not to mention profit.&quot; Аргон Federation Admiral Homer Anselm commented: &quot;We need our weapons where we can get at them.

Food companies across space have been complaining of BoFu exploding into shreds when the containers are opened. Somehow an excess of Boron BoGas appears to have been introduced into the cubed BoFu and this produces the explosion when the lids are popped.\n\nQuite why somebody would play such a joke on the Boron BoFu industry is a mystery but it follows a pattern of similar strange incidents. The Теладі Nostrop Oil corporations were recently plagued by highly-carbonated Nostrop being introduced into their product lines. The resulting &quot;fizzy Nostrop&quot; is said to have coated many Теладі with oil from head to foot. One Nostrop producer has gone so far as to offer a bounty for the head of the responsible party.\n\nElsewhere, the Паранід have discovered several consignments of rubber Soja Husks and the Аргон have found Cahoona Steaks that &quot;moo&quot; at anyone trying to cut them up.

Dealing in prohibited alcohol and drugs, outlawed weapons systems and even the scourge of slavery have long been regarded as a problem by some governments, notably the Аргон Federation and the Boron Kingdom.\n\nOther governments regard the issues with greater flexibility, the Паранід having no scruples when it comes to weaponry and the Теладі quite openly tolerating the drugs trade. In addition, the Спліт dependence on slave labour means that this evil market is ever a source of profit for those willing to engage in the trade.\n\nThere are large profits to be made by those willing to risk the wrath of governments that frown on such trading. The penalties can be severe and slavers, in particular, should be warned that the Аргон and Boron will not look kindly on their business.

A number of major players in the food distribution industry have acknowledged that they do not have the capacity to meet all demand and that much work exists for freelance traders and small cargo-carrier outfits.\n\nThe effects of this trend have even been seen in the relatively conservative station-building sector, with demand for agricultural facilities and processing factories rising steadily.

The package is a small memory wipe programme that will be broadcast to any captured ship the first time pilots access the board computer. The programme works automatically through the communication system and no extra effort will be necessary by the capturing pilot. All current privately owned Ксенон ships that have already docked have been memory wiped by station technicians and while there is no further threat from this type of attack, pilots are asked to remain vigilant for other forms of Ксенон trickery.\n\nFunfi Hu - Military Correspondent, Galnet News[/justify][/text]</t>

Cargo space would be uncompressed, rendering the ship useless for carrying cargo, and further engine tunings and rudder tunings would not be possible. A new reaction system would also eject vital parts of the ship out along with the pilot, such as shields and navigation systems, thus hopefully bringing the attack to the attention of the local law enforcement ships.

A smaller craft armed with 18 lasers and the then newly-developed 125MJ shields. It came into service during the Ксенон Conflict replacing the Аргон Century as the main battleship. The Century was later decommissioned as it was not powerful enough to cope with the demands of modern combat. The reign of the Titan continued for many jazuras until the Аргон government took on a radical new design. Longer than the Mk-I Titan, the MK-II Titan reminded people of Boron submarine craft. The design of the ship took many people by surprise, it was not like any other ship design to date.\n\nThe Mk-III is the latest design. More advanced technologies were used when constructing this vessel, and the Titan Mk-III was born. Its original purpose was to be an explorer ship as new jumpgates were being found. But the Mk-II design was showing its age. The length of the ship meant it was hard to manoeuvre. Poor forward velocity also made this problem worse. The rate of turn was so bad that it earned a nickname of &quot;Old Argnu&quot; as it was said that it was easier to steer a cow.\n\nMk-III is much improved. It is the current favourite with many Аргон Captains, although some still wish they could fly the much older Mk-I Titan and Century Craft their ancestors piloted.[/justify][/text]</t>

A senior politician, Getling Wilde will present him with the Medal of Valour tomorrow on Аргон Prime.\n\nJak Yerly was in the 15th Platoon in Пояс Руди when his unit was attacked by five Pirate Orinocos, two Bayamons and a Pirate TS. The seven M4 Аргон ships were quickly outnumbered. Jak ordered to fire on the pirate TS first, the combined force of the seven ships made easy work of bringing down the shields. One Аргон Buster was lost when all pirate ships fired upon it.\n\nJak was able to get the two Bayamon fighters to chase him through the belt and into a hollow asteroid. Deft handling allowed him to fit his ship through a tight gap and away to safety; the Bayamon pilots weren't so lucky and were destroyed. The rest of the ships were able to outrun the Orinocos and also made their way to safety. If Jak Yerly had fought the Пірат head-on, all the Аргон would have perished. The military have promoted Jak to Commander due to his many acts of bravery and quick-thinking throughout his service.\n\nTomes Nedley - Documentary Writer - IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

It is reported that there have been a number of fatalities. The eastern continent is extensively settled by small but widely dispersed village and town communities. The continent is heavily wooded and provides lumber for the rest of the planet as well as specialist and exotic woods for the architectural and art materials trade. A burgeoning tourist economy has also been an increasingly valuable secondary industry in the region. All this is now threatened by massive flame-fronts extending over wide swathes of countryside.\n\nDisaster control authorities on the planet say that they simply do not have the resources to put the fires out and are concentrating on protecting settlements. It is hoped the fires will burn themselves out but the cost will be enormous. There is already talk of arson and sabotage with rumours of off-world visitors setting fires deliberately. Some have suggested that a foreign power is behind the fires and one direct accusation is against the Паранід. The suggestion here is that some particularly fine woods threatened the trade of inlaid majaglit furniture and other items. The Паранід government has flatly denied the accusation.\n\nHack Seldon - Social Affairs Correspondent IBC News [/justify][/text]</t>

The location is highly classified, however rumour tells us that it is set up in close vicinity to Південно-Західна Хмарна База, somewhere outside the main system area. Other rumours tells us also that the station has its own system drive, allowing it to fly freely in vicinity of the system. Officially no one has been confirmed having visited this station yet, quite probably because it is not marked on any maps. On the other hand even if anyone does manage to find it he probably will not be allowed to dock. A large number of laser turrets are armed to take out every ship approaching without permission.\n\nThe main goal of establishing this centre is to find weak points in jumpdrive construction and eliminate them, as well as to find new advantages that will improve the use of this drive. It could be, for example, a way to lower fuel cell consumption or even to jump without the use of energy cells. Another topic could be to improve the programming system which is used by the autopilot for setting the autojump sequence where there are no crew on board. This drive sometimes has been known to cause malfunctions where the ship using it would jump out near super-novae or the black holes.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

Two small pirate vessels moved directly into the path of an incoming trader ship as it passed through a gate, then following it inside the station, they murdered the trader and successfully avoided defence measures by taking out the main power supply generators.\n\nThis action left the dock unarmed for a few mizuras. Unfortunately it was enough time to choose from one of the many docked ships with potentially valuable cargo inside and take it out. The &quot;Bringer of life&quot;, a Lifter-type transport, owned by Jo Jovi, was blasted open in a moment. Fortunately the trader was not inside. Пірат then collected as much the remaining goods as they could and, destroying the main doors with rockets from inside, moved out the station. Using jumpdrive units they easily escaped with the booty.\n\n&quot;This unbelievable action is a shame for all police forces stationed in this system,&quot; stated the Аргон Minister of Defence, announcing also that those who didn't fulfil their duties would be severely punished. &quot;We cannot allow for such actions in the future,&quot; he continued &quot;and we have decided to assign a special fund for all necessary improvements, which will help Federal Аргон stations to feel safe from pirate activity&quot;.

This would be the single biggest recruitment in the history of our military.\n\nIt is still not clear how the Fleet plans to use these new recruits or how they will accommodate them. Recent appropriations have been heavily focused on upgrading Boron weaponry, not on building more ships or training installations. This has led to rumours that our leaders have been forced into an emergency recruitment drive for reasons they are not prepared to share with the public. A group of representatives in the Commonwealth Assembly plan to raise the issue at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIn a related move, it is rumoured that the Boron Secret Service is actively looking for independent pilots to carry out covert missions.

A spate of attacks in and around Простір Королеви is causing a lot of talk and even more nervousness amongst Boron traders.\n\nOnly one pilot, having survived the attacks, was too shaken to give a coherent report. The only words to have come from Hago Bli's mouth have been &quot;like vicious wolves&quot; and &quot;never saw them coming&quot;. He was one of the pilots doing the standard Nostrop Oil run between Баксоїд Начальника and Королівський Вінець when their convoy was attacked. All the freighters and escorts, including five Boron Eels, were blown to so much space dust. Miraculously, the attackers did not spot Bli who seems to have ejected rather more quickly than his colleagues. No-one knows whether the other pilots were taken for slaves or brutally killed in space.\n\nTraditionally, the sectors close to Королівський Вінець have been relatively free of pirate and mercenary activity. Rumours point to a band of renegade Пірат, possibly supported by one of the more warlike races. There are even those who suggest help from beyond known space, given the amazing effectiveness of these attacks.

A mitigating factor is the delivery time required for each ship, but with shipyards working overtime to fulfil orders, and with more orders anticipated it is unclear what the outcome will be.\n\nAnother factor that is of concern to Boron traders is the fact that according to manufacturing logs, virtually all TL class ships have had maximum cargo capacity upgrades specified as standard.

The ban came about after well-known wedding entertainer Na t'Knt created a new multi-colour additive, complete with explosions and other pyrotechnics. Unfortunately Na t'Knt misjudged the quantities, and the resulting explosion led to his ship impacting on the local trading station in Вогонь Ронкар amid a quite spectacular and colourful death.

Seizing on an idea from the Теладі, Boron factory owners had fought for the right to be able to advertise products, wares and services other than their own on the illuminated station logo boards. The Boron government were against this idea, believing that foreign traders in the sectors would then not know exactly what the station was selling, particularly as other races often comment that all Boron stations look similar already. The factory owners argued that as they legally owned the stations, they could do whatever they wished with them. The deciding factor came when the Теладі advertising agency holding all the new advertising contracts went into liquidation last wozura, citing extraordinary costs and lack of income.\n\nBolo Fi - Social Affairs Correspondent, RCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Even so, many Спліт pilots still consider the ship to be cursed.\n\n500 Спліт died in the incident, and today Family Leaders from the lesser families Kaii and T'kr, held a period of remembrance as they stopped working on the ships in the dock.

But this day was a tragedy.\nFive Hundred Спліт workers from the Family Kaii and T'kr were killed as the station exploded when its newest ship attempted to depart. The Dragon heralded a new dawn for the Спліт people, but a fracture in its reactor casing caused a catastrophic explosion that resulted in the destruction of three other ships in construction.\n\nPrimary construction moved several jumps away to the nearest shipyards. Plans were drawn up to build a new series of shipyards, including smaller docks incase such an event should ever happen again. Kaii and T'kr never recovered after the death of their workers, and Family T'kr were held responsible for the reactor explosion. The leader of Family T'kr was executed and half of its assets seized. Kaii lost nothing as they were employed to assist T'kr.\n\nConstruction of the Dragon re-started, - the first two of the Mk II prototypes were lost in Невідомий circumstances and, a third ship disappeared without a trace. Спліт pilots consider the Dragon to be eternally cursed. Haunted by the souls of those who died in the incident. Every jazura on the anniversary of the explosion, all Спліт spend two mizuras remembering the dead.\n\nGu't Nnt - Documentary Writer SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

The five-times Paramount Gladiator is now in his 50th jazura of professional deathmatching and has confirmed that it will be his last. No professional gladiator has previously retired in the history of the sport. It has been a universal rule that professionals die in the arena. However, no previous professional has survived beyond 40 jazuras of deathmatching, let alone 50.\n\nIt is a mark of the skill of Toqaw t'Fvtt that he has reached this stage. It is said that the doughty fighter was persuaded to retire by the Professional Deathmatchers Club. They have offered him a contract as supervisor of a planned academy of deathmatchers. No shame devolves on Toqaw t'Fvtt, particularly as he fights with a prosthetic leg and arm. The PDC may be concerned that a way for older deathmatchers to retire should be established. A number of professionals are heading towards 50 jazuras of deathmatching and the Club is concerned to retain their experience to the benefit of all Спліт.\n\nJarac t'Mttj - Sports Correspondent SFN News [/justify][/text]</t>

For those of you that don't, this clever little planet-designed gadget was aimed at hot-headed Спліт everywhere. Being a mighty warrior and a little short tempered is not always a good combination! So the Nowhey was designed. Made from innovative flexible materials, it is about half the size of a Спліт and virtually indestructible. In a moment of rage, it can be stabbed, punched, kicked, bitten and even whipped against a bulkhead and it will not break. It was designed to let angry Спліт take out their vengeance and temper without hurting anyone or damaging anything. Sadly, the plan has backfired. It seems that most Спліт are even more furious at not being able to damage the Nowhey, and have started looking for the next best thing, notably each other. After a three fold increase in fatalities in the last wozura alone, the Nowhey has now been withdrawn from sale and all use of them banned in public places. This should be a lesson to all Спліт - a warrior's spirit can never be subdued.\n\nCho't Lt, Social Affairs Correspondent, SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Never straying far from the jump gates, Спліт forces were able to destroy many smaller Ксенон craft before jumping back to safety prior to attack by a Ксенон capital ship. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a cowardly way for the Спліт to fight, but merely using the appropriate tactics for this situation - pilots were keen to emphasize this.\n\nThe attacks were made in a successful attempt to stem similar style raids by the Ксенон into Спліт sectors. Whilst this will work over the short term, the ultimate goal is of course to destroy the Ксенон Shipyard. No such attempt was made during this recent assault. Over 30 Ксенон ships have been destroyed so far, and military commanders are hailing this as a great victory. Unconfirmed reports put Спліт fatalities at less than 5.

The fires on the Аргон planet have devastated large portions of the forests of that world and there are believed to have been a number of deaths. The Аргон government has made no direct accusation or even hinted at the involvement of any external power. Even so, sources in Схованка Ньяни have whispered that a &quot;foreign power&quot; was &quot;jealous&quot; of the fine and exotic woods of Nyana's Planet. This has been taken to be a reference to the Priest Dukes and their natural concern to maintain the majaglit industry and in particular the fine inlaid furniture trade.\n\nWhile the Priest Dukes have denied the possibility of any Паранід involvement in the possible arson on Nyana's Planet, they have not issued any further comment and are believed to be reluctant to make an issue out of the accusation given that it is not coming from the Аргон government itself.

The planet, in independent Olmancketslat's Treaty sector, has long been settled by a variety of renegades and refugees from the space powers. Аргон, Паранід, Спліт and Теладі individuals and families have established cities and independent statelets in profusion across the face of the planet. Only Boron malcontents are lacking in numbers due to the somewhat arid atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe official view of the Паранід Empire and the Priest Dukes on behalf of the Priest Emperor is that the war is of little consequence to Паранід interests. The sector does not sit astride any unique routes across space, indeed has always been something of a side market for the Паранід Empire's merchants. For whatever reason the Спліт Families appear to regard it as important enough to send troops there. Alternatively, some observers of the Спліт have suggested that the troops are being so readily sent in order to give them combat experience. It seems likely that the troops will gain that in abundance as it is reported that the AFS rebels are hiring offworld mercenaries specialising in ground combat. The AFS control a number of resource-rich regions and appear well able to finance large mercenary armies. The Спліт involvement is by no means a guarantee of a quick end to this war.\n\nLoakmanckelong - Foreign Affairs Correspondent IPN News [/justify][/text]</t>

Trantaeos says the group were chasing rich seams of silicon but other sources suggest the gambler was duped by tales of wealth beyond measure. &quot;It's the same old con,&quot; said an anonymous source. &quot;She was duped by tales of nividium in them thar asteroids! There were only a few scraggly seams of silicon and metal ore of course.

The Joint Caravan was a plan to run armed convoys through independent and outer territories using Теладі and Boron naval vessels.\n\nThe scheme was conceived by Profit Protection Admiral Betndyis Ylyliys Bywumys V and she commented: &quot;The Boron Royal Navy is obsessed with its rigid notions of command and loyalty to the Crown. We Теладі respect the Boron Crown but cannot allow the archaic views of Royal Officers to result in loss of profits. The Теладі-Boron Joint Caravan is indefinitely suspended.&quot;\n\nThe Central All-Теладі Stock Exchange rallied at the news, an indication of the market's dissatisfaction with the plan as a whole and its relief that the project is suspended.

While some have suggested this was caused by maintenance failures, the hot theory is that a terrorist or mercenary faction has carried out a bombing. Аргон security are hunting for any and all leads that could point to one group over another. It is reported that the Аргон are even looking hard at the activities of the other powers, though it is highly unlikely that even the Спліт would directly sponsor an attack on an Аргон station.\n\nWhile it would be highly embarrassing for the Аргон authorities if this explosion does turn out to be the result of negligence and therefore a simple accident, it would be far more interesting if a terrorist group has decided to embark on a campaign of indiscriminate bombings on targets in Аргон space. The latter would tie up many security resources that the Аргон are currently relying on in their anti-piracy operations. If this were to happen it could herald many new opportunities in Аргон space.\n\nOberon Waellsly - Crime Correspondent MIN News [/justify][/text]</t>

The amateur gambling champion was fleeced for a cool 15 million credits when the mining corporation she had invested in folded leaving several backers without a credit chip to show for it. Trantaeos claims she was approached by a character called Max Enron who spoke of developing silicon seams in Скриня Скарбів sector. However, our sources say the gullible gambler was duped by the old tale of nividium under the rocks.\n\nTrantaeos has asked the Profit Guild to step in but they are known to be unsympathetic when a Теладі foolishly loses every credit in some scheme that goes bankrupt. Even were they to be interested, the Аргон authorities in Скриня Скарбів say they have no record of  &quot;Max Enron&quot; and report that the New TC Mining Group was registered using, irony of ironies, a numbered account at the Profit Guild Bank in Сейзвел.

The Теладі pilot, Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, used a jumpdrive fitted to her modified Boron Octopus to skip 4 sectors on the course. The usual punishment for cheating during a race is for the offender to be released into a planetary atmosphere to burn to death. This punishment was avoided however, as 3 of the other race pilots tracked down the cheating Теладі and destroyed her ship, killing her instantly. In the absence of the original &quot;winner&quot;, the prize of 10,000 credits was awarded to the pilot who was the first to finish without cheating, a Паранід pilot named Sao't Sht. The bonus of 5,000 credits for beating the course record has been returned to the race organisers.\n\nIn related news, it would appear that gate race pilots are improving in skill. After a season of races where the average number of competitor deaths from collisions was 25, and the individual races never had less than 12, it is interesting to note that the last race only contained 4 deaths. This includes the death of Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, the cheating Теладі pilot. A good example of evolution at work.\n\nVal Gisler - Sports Correspondent, MIN[/justify][/text]</t>

The TS class vessel carrying the precious liquid was totally destroyed and a number of nearby vessels were damaged.

It was unbelievable, we never knew there was so much information available about it.&quot; Noah's final tour took the tourists to the holographic room, where they were shown the short holofilm that was found on an asteroid a long time ago in the old sector of Хмари Ронкар. The tourists were amazed and in a way sad at the way the earth was befallen by the chaos of war with the terraformers, and how they got the name of Аргон. Derived from Nathan R. Gunn, the captain of the fleet that tricked the terraformers to follow them through a secret gate which was later destroyed. The group was awed at the chase that lead the earth fleet through many sectors in this universe. Some were in tears at the way the earth fleet was gradually picked off one by one by the evil terraformers, now known as the Ксенон. The final crash by the remaining ship from the earth fleet and how they finally settled down on Аргон Prime.\n\nMany tourists had never heard of the earth test pilot that ended up stranded in the Теладі sector of Сейзвел, and how his ship had got here without the use of a jumpdrive. Kept secret for many jazuras by many governments, they learned how he had found the holographic data disk in the old sector of Хмари Ронкар, which the earth pilot had returned to the Goners, the final battle that took the races to final victory over the Ксенон, and how they kept the Ксенон in retreat to now form the current shape of the universe.\n\nNoah Gaffelt later said, &quot;I always love the final part of the tour, as the tourists watch in horror at the holographic movie, its a tragedy and in a way gives us many lessons to learn about the war which befell earth.

In an effort to conclude this argument and gain more knowledge of the tournament which our conservative brothers are calling 'a brutal excuse for the conflict of war without the political implications' and which continues to divide our brotherhood a Гонер Chiun Ta Cho master, Master Hwange was entered as an Аргон competitor.  As you all know the art Chiun Ta Cho is practiced among us to preserve the body and calm the spirit and has no direct connection with violence of any kind.  Nonetheless Master Hwange was able to defeat his first opponent the Паранід, Falix Halifalix by methodically avoiding his blows for 17 hours before Falix collapsed of exhaustion.  Master Hwange then forfeited his place in the competition by refusing to face fellow Аргон, Nathan Gunner. It is uncertain what experiences Master Hwange will share\nwith us when he returns but it is certain that while our brotherhood is divided over this issue we must remember that it is our only difference and that we may disagree here and remain united in other things, preserving our order, as we have done in less fortunate centuries than this one.\n\nJo Springer - Social And Culture Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

At present, there is of course no obligation to grow a beard as a Гонер, yet most choose to do so as it is traditional. Clean shaven Goners argue that they are being discriminated against - all the high council have beards and infact there has never been a clean shaven Гонер elected to this lofty position. The beard brigade dismiss this as nonsense, and have suggested that if the clean shaven Goners spent more time worshipping and studying instead of worrying about facial hair, then maybe they would in time become more worthy of a council position.

Marais was born an Аргон in the Туманність Херона sector and made a life for himself as a fighter pilot. He took part in many engagements and several of the border wars that have cursed our age. A chance encounter with one of our brothers, whose name is not known, changed the life of Brother Marais. He travelled to the Great Temple in Cloudbase Southwest and duly decided to follow the Гонер Way.\n\nIn the course of his life with us, Brother Marais became famous for his metaphysical jokes and perplexing questions. Famously he asked a Спліт warrior, visiting the Temple as part of the then Спліт Ambassador's entourage, &quot;How sharp is a sword with no blade?&quot; Much taken with this, the Спліт warrior went away. Several mazura later, that warrior, Kao 't Pst, became the first Спліт to follow the Гонер Way.\n\nBrother Marais had a great sense of humour and while he could publish such masterworks as Philosophical Investigations into the Hidden Universe, he could also produce the famed and much-loved No Joke Left Unturned, acknowledged by many professional comedians as a fund of material.

Rolf is the first missionary for over 3 jazura to die of natural causes \(all others being killed or captured whilst flying\) and he will be well remembered by all of us. Donations for his remembrance will be gratefully received by the temple \(denominations of 10 credits only please\).

Whilst we are completely opposed to slavery, particularly of our own, it is interesting to note that this has resulted in more conversions to our faith. It seems that our captured missionaries have continued to preach the faith to their fellow slaves, who are converting in their droves. Rumour has it that the Спліт mine owners are concerned about this, but cannot stop the religion spreading as every time they try to suppress it, another martyr to the cause is born. It is extremely gratifying to know that the Гонер faith is helping so many slaves come to terms with their conditions now.

It was thought that this experiment would promote greater understanding and conversion within the Спліт race, plus Jes Ramussen was convinced that his faith would allow him to overcome the fearsome Ghok without the need for violence. Entering the arena in an almost trance-like state, the contest ultimately lasted just under one mizura, and then only that long as the Ghok appeared to have trouble swallowing Ramussen's clothing in addition to the rest of his body \(Гонер robes are quite prickly and itchy\).

They argue that the sale or purchase of Гонер ships should be made illegal, as they could only have been sourced by illegal means. Shipyard owners disagree, saying that this would stifle the free-market liberal trading economy that the races have worked so hard to establish, and would set a precedent that could lead to other products being banned as well. The debate was sparked after the High Council released the astonishing figures for last jazura, reporting a loss of 207 ships, and after new ship production, a net loss of 45 ships. This has prompted the High Council to demand that captured ships be returned to the Goners and their former owners prosecuted.

The mercenaries, who  had all knowledge of their employers chemically wiped out, were to use a matter transporter to deliver a primed Hornet class missile into the main concourse of the station. If such a weapon were to detonate in an unshielded area of that kind it would tear the facility apart.\n\nGoner Intelligence have long monitored the whereabouts of matter transmission devices and became concerned some mazura ago, when a transmat-equipped Теладі vessel was reported lost to a pirate attack. It now appears that agents of Гонер Intelligence were successfully able to trace the device and pass on the information to Аргон authorities.\n\nWhile the mercenaries have no memory of their employers, they were able to name a numbered account at the Теладі Profit Guild Bank in Гордість Компанії . Аргон agents found the account to be empty after obtaining a warrant from Guild authorities. The Теладі factor in the affair has been noted but seems nothing more than circumstantial at this time.

 <t id="8">[article][eval if_race='Спліт'/][/article][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]Спліт Ex-prison Chief to debate the Death Penalty[/title][text cols='2'][justify]After a long heated debate about how the death penalty should be given, it's been finally decided that the Спліт courts will offer this capital punishment less than what it was but &quot;there will still be terrible consequences for breaking the laws.&quot; Buyo remarked.\n\nWe asked what are these terrible consequences only to get from him: &quot;This information will remain disclosed to people above a certain clearance level, but we can assure you, you wouldn't want to know.&quot;\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="9">[article][eval if_race='Спліт'/][/article][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]Спліт Ex-prison Chief to debate the Death Penalty[/title][text cols='2'][justify]A discussion about the death penalty for criminals and enemies of the Спліт will be taking place in a short while with hopes to make the death penalty a less used sentence then the 79% of times it's given out in cases held in past times. The ex-prison official, Temon Buyo, commented at the press conference prior to the holding of the meeting, that:\n\n&quot;It would be better to keep the sentence as it is. The Спліт aren't feared the way the Ксенон or Boron are... we must make sure that everyone knows that we aren't pushovers&quot;.\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="10">[article][eval if_race='Теладі'/][/article][author]{1294,50}[/author][title]Teladianium prices predicted to rise[/title][text cols='1' colwidth='500'][justify]According to the Metal Brokers, Thelisias Pontamonen Arakos, the price of Teladianium is predicted to rise. Demand has skyrocketed since the start of the troubles with the Хаак. It may be a short term effect with more Teladianium Mines coming on-line every Tazura. Aggenmenas Glutamus Fakatos, the chief Broker for the company said &quot;The market shows sign of a shortage that should correct itself in the medium to long term. We are recommending a buy at the moment&quot;.\n\nThe owner of the Brokers, Thelisias Pontamonen Arakos IV, owns more than half of all Teladianium mines and was unavailable for comment.\n\nYoyunis Towisaris Yooses IV - Foreign Affairs Correspondent CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]First impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are now negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. The most important changes will be made to the rules regarding the Jumpgate Exit Procedure, the placement of satellites and overtaking of slower spacecrafts. It is planned that so called &quot;gate sleepers&quot; are to be fined a high amount of credits. &quot;Gate sleepers&quot; who accelerate too slowly after having passed the gate have caused a lot of accidents in the past, especially in sectors with high traffic density. Still there is a controversial debate on whether to make the use of Boost-Drives mandatory for spacecrafts with low acceleration capability in order to enable them to leave the dangerous area fast enough.\n\nBut, as all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]More impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are still negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. We can now present some more details: There will be special areas for the communication satellites to place them into space. This is meant to be a measure against the &quot;wild&quot; placement of satellites as it is being practised nowadays. Satellites get destroyed too often causing increasing troubles for the indemnification insurance business. The Теладі delegation proposed to protect these satellite areas with SQUASH mines. While the Паранід have already agreed to this proposal and the Спліт are expected to follow, the Boron and Аргон are likely to offer some resistance because of their general ban on these weapons. They prefer lasertowers.\n\nBut, as already mentioned in another article, because all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>
