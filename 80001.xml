They are the size of a small bird and seem to be made out of delicate shinning gossamer that reacts to light and shimmers and shines in a multitude of colours.(||) The Markus live in vast complex hives hollowed out of asteroids and perform a valuable function by collecting space junk and other debris, which they capture and take back to their asteroids to be used in the construction of their hives. They travel together in great swarms and communicate with a series of musical notes, similar to bird song, that echo inside space. Their beauty, and the beauty of their music, is famed throughout the X Universe and all intelligent space races delight in seeing them. Pilots will stop to watch a swarm fly past. Creatures working on the outside of ships and space stations have claimed that the Markus will fly near them and even perch on them, singing all the while. However throughout space sightings of The Markus Space Fly are becoming very rare. This is manly due to the actions of The Спліт, who capture and use the small space fly to power their spaceships. Currently the Foundation Guild are pressing for the Markus to be made a protected species and pressure is being put on the Спліт to change their system of powering their space ship engines. It is believed that, despite a universal ban on their capture or trading, some Пірат still hunt and capture this creature in order to sell then to the Спліт.</t>

 <t id="3101">Federal Аргон Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3102">{17,3108} {17,3109}</t>
 <t id="3108">(General description for all shipyards)Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. They are factories of gigantic dimension, built to manufacture all the space vehicles and even build and sell whole construction kits for new factories. Because of the immense resources and labour required to build as well as run a factory like this, shipyards are rare to encounter.</t>
 <t id="3109">Аргон shipyards are large, automated industrial plants, dedicated to the construction of the entire range of Аргон space ships. In addition to the valuable raw materials and technology, these factories also contain experimental areas where new designs and ship improvements are always being developed and tested, and as a result are heavily guarded. Therefore all Аргон shipyards should be approached with great caution.</t>
 <t id="3112">The Аргон Colossus is the Carrier Class of the Аргон. In its working lifespan, this ship has seen many changes. It is heavily armed with 6 cannons and replaces the previous class, which was originally built in response to rumours of a Ксенон super ship uncovered by the Аргон Secret Service. Because of its success, the Аргон built many ships of this new class. As new technologies have been developed, these ships have undergone several major refits in recent jazuras. The flagship of the Аргон carrier fleet is the Аргон One stationed in Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="3122">Up to the building of Аргон One, the Titan was the biggest ship in the Аргон fleet. It is a destroyer class battleship armed with 18 lasers. Although heavy and difficult to manoeuvre, in the hands of a capable Аргон Captain, this ship is a powerful weapon with a noble heritage.(||) Its predecessors fought and won many major battles in both the Ксенон Conflict and Boron Campaign. Since then the ship has been regularly updated and redesigned, but is still basically the same ship.</t>
 <t id="3142">The Аргон Buster was once the pride of the Аргон fleet and was instrumental in gaining the Аргон victory in the Ксенон Conflict. However during the Boron campaign it was superseded by the Аргон Elite.(||) Over the intervening jazuras the design of the Аргон Buster has been modified and new, more powerful engines have been fitted. Now updated, and armed with two lasers, the Buster is the number two fighter ship of the Аргон Fighter Command.</t>
 <t id="3152">The Аргон Discoverer compared to other ships in the Аргон Fleet, is relatively young. It is armed with two lasers, is light, versatile, and very manoeuvrable.(||) It is the preferred training fighter for Аргон pilots with the more experienced being promoted to fly the more exacting Buster and the Nova. Today they are also used for scouting, and it is quite common to find a small wing of these ships accompanying an exploration carrier.</t>
 <t id="3162">The Аргон Mammoth is a Heavy Transporter ship, usually found in Аргон Federation territory. It is so large that it cannot dock at any space station, instead it is loaded and unloaded by docking some distance from the station, having its freight ferried backwards and forwards by fleets of smaller transporters.(||) These ships are owned by successful private entrepreneur pilots who have made a great investment in order to purchase them - therefore they are more than keen to hire out their services.</t>
 <t id="3181">Free Аргон Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3182">Typical Аргон Space station used throughout entire Аргон federation territory. Developed by Аргон over many jazuras these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas, and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres. Each space station is under jurisdiction of The Аргон Federation and is governed by an elected senator. He represents the station in the main Аргон Parliament. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
 <t id="3191">Аргон Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3192">Аргон Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Аргон territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3201">Royal Boron Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3202">{17,3108} {17,3209}</t>
 <t id="3209">The Boron shipyard is a hive of activity, mainly due to the fact that the Boron do not believe in a lot of automation, instead preferring to trust the fine skills and talents of their many engineers, craftsmen, and semi skilled workers. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, and they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="3212">The Boron Shark is a fast carrier class battleship and replaces the much older and outdated Boron Cuttlefish. It is believed that this new ship was designed and constructed in light of the rumours of the Ксенон BMS and, together with the Аргон One, presents a formidable opposition to any enemy.(||) It is well known that Аргон technology was traded with the Boron to enable them to produce such a ship and that the two ships were designed to compliment each other.</t>
 <t id="3222">This Boron destroyer is fast, manoeuvrable and, despite the Borons peaceful nature, very deadly. It is heavily armed, and its weapons are complemented with powerful shield generators.(||) Its design and technology was revolutionary, as most of the older Boron designs were scrapped and remade after the Boron Conflict. It is manned by the highly trained pilots of the Boron Space Fleet.</t>
 <t id="3252">The Octopus was developed to be the Boron version of the Discoverer.(||) Its design was revolutionary and all races, when it was first seen, were very keen to know how effective it was. The success of the Octopus sent ripples throughout the Boron sectors as more was produced, but today it is considered to be obsolete, although it is still in service.</t>
 <t id="3262">The Boron Orca is a heavy-duty transporter craft, fractionally bigger than the Аргон Mammoth. It cannot dock directly at a space station and has to rely on a relay of smaller ships to ferry cargo backwards and forwards to it.(||) Despite looking cumbersome the Orca is manoeuvrable and is slightly faster than Аргон Mammoth. Many of these ships are privately owned and it is possible to hire them - for a price.</t>
 <t id="3272">The Boron Dolphin is a cost effective transporter ship. Its unique Boron technology has been developed and combined with Аргон know-how to produce a transporter that can carry great loads whilst moving gracefully.(||) It can be found in most Boron sectors.</t>
 <t id="3281">Royal Boron Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3282">The Space Stations of the Boron are not comfortable due to heavy ammonia content of their atmosphere. Despite that many different races frequently use them as the Boron are not only members of the Foundation Guild but also benefit from established trade agreements with Теладі and Паранід.(||) Each space station is governed by an Imperial Captain selected by the Boron government and whose position is verified by the Boron Royal Family.</t>

 <t id="3301">Спліт Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3302">{17,3108} {17,3309}</t>
 <t id="3309">At first the shipyards belonging to the Спліт seem to look like prison camps. That is not far from the truth as the ruling Спліт council commit all their criminals to serve time labouring inside the shipyards.(||) The Спліт shipyards are heavily guarded and it is very rare for a member of any race to get close enough to them to make a full report before getting shot down.</t>
 <t id="3312">The Raptor is the Спліт carrier ship. It first made an appearance in the war against the Boron when it proved to be effective but vulnerable to attack from beneath. It is believed that, over the intervening jazuras, the Спліт have re-developed the ship to eliminate this problem.(||) A High-ranking Спліт officer who is linked by kin to the ruling family clan commands the ship. Generally they are even more abrasive and arrogant than the other members of their race.</t>
 <t id="3322">The Python is the one of the most effective destroyer ships in Спліт Sectors. It is well armed, and lethal. It is also one of the most aggressive ships in the universe, its captains all being briefed to fire first and ask questions later.(||) There are rumours of a second, more powerful, class of destroyer that was used during a Спліт family feud, but it is thought that these ships no longer exist as the Python is still being produced.</t>
 <t id="3332">A long serving and deadly fighter developed by the Спліт Military. It has been only in recent jazuras that this ship has been made public.(||) The current Спліт Patriarch has a small fleet of these ships that act as escort ships that accompany the primary destroyer of the fleet. In the hands of an experienced pilot, this ship can survive the darkest of battles, because of the ships high speed he can avoid most of laserbeams and missiles.</t>
 <t id="3342">A forerunner of this ship fought in the Boron Campaign and proved to be a very powerful opponent. Like most of the other Спліт ships, this new design was more based on high speed engines and big weapon power, as in great shield strengths.(||) Over the jazuras this ship had been totally up-dated and rearmed.</t>
 <t id="3362">This huge Transporter is too large to dock in any space station and carries a number of smaller freighters to load and unload its trading goods.(||) It is believed that this Transporter is an evolutionary form of a much smaller Transporter called the Rhino, which seems to have been phased out over the last hundred jazuras. It is believed that a different Спліт family clan controls each Transporter.</t>
 <t id="3381">Спліт Trading Port</t>
 <t id="3382">The Спліт Space Stations are dark and unfriendly places. Visiting trading races are tolerated but not encouraged to stay longer than necessary and are not allowed inside the inner structure.(||) Few members of the Аргон race ever venture near enough to them for more detailed information to be compiled. It is believed that many of them are owned by the various ruling family clans.</t>

 <t id="3402">{17,3108} {17,3409}</t>
 <t id="3409">The Паранід build their spaceships in large automated assembly plants. In these factories they forge their own metals and plastics, design and develop new ships, as well as constructing and testing the entire range of Паранід space ships.</t>
 <t id="3412">The Zeus is the primary carrier in the Паранід Fleet. Information about this ship other than the fact that it as very deadly as result of new weapon technologies, are not released.(||) This ships tactics are not to get close to battle, and to release its swarm of powerful fighters from a distance. Паранід pilots have been known to hide their ships in dense asteroid fields to keep their signature from hostile craft.</t>
 <t id="3422">This destroyer is the pride of the Паранід Fleet. It was developed from an earlier model used by the Паранід in their alliance with the Спліт in the Boron Campaign.(||) It is believed that this ship was last updated during the threat of conflict between the Паранід and the Спліт.</t>
 <t id="3452">This ship is the main fighter craft of the Паранід race, and the most common. It has a good speed and is armed with two front mounted laser.(||) Constantly being updated, this ship also dates back to the earlier period of the Паранід Спліт war against the Boron.</t>
 <t id="3462">This ship is the largest transporter in the Паранід Fleet. It is too big to dock at space stations and employs a fleet of shuttlecraft to load and unload its cargo.(||) It is commanded by a lesser Priest Baron, who is directly under the command of its original space station Priest Duke commander. It is believed that many of these ships can be hired for certain commissions - however those conditions do not apply to members of the Аргон race.</t>
 <t id="3472">This ship is the most common of the Паранід transporter ships. It travels great distances, carrying many different goods.(||) Due to the complex hierarchical structure of the Паранід race it is commanded by a lesser Priest Lord under the command of its home space station Priest Duke.</t>
 <t id="3481">Паранід Trading Dock</t>
 <t id="3482">This space station is highly developed and features the latest Паранід technology, however due to their secretive nature, very few people are allowed inside its inner body.(||) Паранід space stations trade mainly with Теладі, Спліт and Boron. Members of Аргон race are allowed to trade but, due to the ongoing animosity between the two races, trade is the only contact the two races have. A Priest Duke commands each space station. It is however believed that each station contains a Паранід temple, access as usual is strictly restricted to Паранід Monks.</t>

 <t id="3492">Паранід Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Паранід territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3501">Теладі Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3502">{17,3108} {17,3509}</t>
 <t id="3509">The shipyards of the Теладі could never be described as hi-tech. Indeed these large factories are packed with a strange assortment of low-tech equipment supplied by many different races, and cobbled together to create a makeshift work area.(||) Long ago the Теладі, ever aware of the need to make profit, decided the most economic way to build space craft was to get someone else to do it for them. They buy ships from other races that are either old, damaged, or just past their sell-by-date which they dismantle, and cannibalise, using the parts and equipment to make ships better suited to their own requirements.</t>
 <t id="3512">The Condor is the carrier ship of the Теладі Company Space Fleet. It is a powerful battleship based upon technology supplied by the Спліт combined with that of the older Аргон Prime VI.(||) Rarely seen outside Теладі sectors the ship is slow but heavily armed and shielded compared to the carriers of other races, its Captains preferring to last longer than others in a battle while still avoiding to get into trouble in the first place.</t>
 <t id="3522">The Phoenix is the destroyer ship operated by the Теладі Company Space Fleet. Its technology is based upon the Паранід Odysseus and the Boron Ray. It is well armed and shielded but rarely known to fight.</t>
 <t id="3532">The Теладі Falcon fighter is a hybrid between the old Аргон Elite and the Boron Piranha, with some Спліт technology thrown in for good measure. It is fast, well armed and can be found operating in most sectors.(||) It is suspected that some of these ships have been leased by the Теладі Company Space Fleet to operate on behalf of the Пірат, although to date no actual proof of this agreement can be established.</t>
 <t id="3562">This huge transporter is too large for any space station and carries its own fleet of smaller transporter ships which load and unload its cargo.(||) It is one of the best shielded large transporter ships, a testimony to the Теладі trait of preferring to last long enough until help arrives. Its basic design and technology is a hybrid between an older version of the Аргон Mammoth and the Паранід Hercules.</t>
 <t id="3572">The Vulture is the trading vessel commonly used by the Теладі in all space sectors and can always be found wherever the largest profit is to be made, no matter in whose sector it happens to be.(||) It is also believed that a number of these transporters have been supplied to the Пірат that operate throughout Теладі sectors in exchange for Невідомий preferential trading services.</t>
 <t id="3581">Теладі Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3582">Теладі space stations are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built for trading purposes.(||) They are not popular places due to the Теладі belief in profit. On each space station everything has a price, and one that is generally higher than other races. Much of the hi-tech equipment on board the station has been bought or traded from other races and so the station inside appears to be a strange hybrid mixture of the various race technologies. Each station is controlled by a citizen who sits on the Теладі governing board.</t>
 <t id="3591">Теладі Space Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3592">Теладі Space Equipment Docks are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3612">The Carrier ship of the Ксенон is a slow yet powerful beast. Armed with Several cannons and fighters stored in its large hangar bay, the Ксенон J is considered a moderate threat.(||) Most ships are able to escape an attack from a J class ship because of its speed. But these ships are usually accompanied by several Destroyer vessels.</t>
 <t id="3622">This destroyer was one of the most powerful ships the Аргон faced in the Ксенон Conflict and its memory still deserves the greatest of respect.(||) It had formidable firepower and a great defensive capability. The Ксенон in the last decade have updated this class of ship. This ship should still be considered as a major threat, although they hardly ever leave their own systems.</t>
 <t id="3632">The L is the most powerful Ксенон fighter developed; it is armed with multiple lasers, and powerful shields.(||) These ships are often seen attacking passing ships trying to take shortcuts through their sectors. Like the other Ксенон ships, the L has been updated in the last few jazuras.</t>
 <t id="3642">The Ксенон M is a fighter craft that first fought in the Ксенон Conflict. It was fast and lethal.(||) Its pilots showed no sign of fear. Indeed many of these ships were used as kamikaze craft, deliberately being crashed into Аргон carriers and destroyers.</t>
 <t id="3652">The N is considered to be a short-range scout ship of the Ксенон, it is only lightly armed but very fast.(||) A forerunner of this ship fought in the Ксенон conflict, but its participation was not considered to be great.</t>
 <t id="3662">The Ксенон I is the largest freighter used by the Ксенон to set up their stations.(||) Like its smaller counterpart, this ship is rarely seen, but it has been known to replace stations destroyed by Attackers. It also is usually accompanied by a group of fighters and sometimes a Ксенон K.</t>
 <t id="3671">Ксенон H</t>
 <t id="3672">The Ксенон H is the smaller freighter used by the Ксенон, this ship has not changed much and is very rare to see.(||) Several fighters usually accompany it. But be warned, as this freighter is capable of carrying heavy weaponry.</t>
 <t id="3681">Ксенон Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3682">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. And all the sentient races have at least one. The Ксенон shipyard is of different construct to the other races, and not much is known about it.(||) What is known is that all the Ксенон ships are constructed here, from the basic Ксенон N to the large Ксенон J Carrier ships. And it is also believed that the Ксенон Mothership was also constructed here. Like most Ксенон installations, it is heavily guarded by a destroyer group. Which is why this station hasn't been destroyed to prevent Ксенон attacks.</t>
 <t id="3691">Ксенон Station</t>
 <t id="3692">This station has been in use since the Ксенон Conflict, it is a simple construct of modules that rotates to generate gravity by using pulses of rotational thrusters.(||) It is unclear what happens on Ксенон Bases, but these stations are located in most Ксенон Sectors. What is clear is that these stations house many ships, from fighters to freighters and are heavily guarded. Approach with caution.</t>
 <t id="3699">The illustrations used are developed from what little knowledge exists to the Аргон Secret Service combined with some expert guess work based upon experience gained during the Ксенон Conflict. It could well be that many of the Ксенон ships have changed shape or that their designs have been updated. It has been assumed that their technology has advanced over the years in a similar way to the other races of the Universe.</t>

 <t id="3762">A pirate base with a difference, this station is much larger and more heavily protected than a standard pirate base, any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters.(||) Unlike its counterpart this station is built using a captured base that existed in this sector before it was seized by a pirate force. This stations trade port and cargo facilities are large, and stocks everything from shields and high-tech weaponry, though to Space weed and Cahoona Meatsteaks. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the Пірат this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation. All manner of pleasures are to be found inside - most of them either highly immoral or highly illegal.</t>
 <t id="3771">Pirate Ship</t>
 <t id="3772">The Пірат often use transporters supplied by the Теладі, but they also use a wide variety of transporter ships that have been captured, stolen or in some cases traded from most races. All of them are armed.(||) These ships are very difficult to spot being heavily camouflaged. They tend to slip through space without being noticed. Even if they are seen they are very difficult to approach as most of them are engaged in highly illegal operations.</t>
 <t id="3781">Pirate Base</t>
 <t id="3782">Despite the Пірат calling their base a space station this pirate base is actually constructed from the hulks of old transporter ships. It is heavily camouflaged and is very difficult to locate and see.(||) It is also rumoured that if the base is in danger of attack, or discovery, it is simply flown to a new secret location. It is also well guarded and any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons, and to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters. Once accepted at the station a pilot may trade anything and everything. No cargo is too dangerous, no price is too high for the right goods. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the Пірат this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation.

 <t id="3812">This ship is considered to be a valuable asset to the Пірат, as they cannot buy ships from any of the races, except ships supplied by the Теладі. It can use a variety of weapons and missiles.(||) It can usually defend itself against similar opponents, and has a fair amount of cargo space. Most of the time it is escorted by Pirate Bayamons and Pirate Mandalays.</t>
 <t id="3822">This fast and powerful ship offers the most versatility for Пірат. It is among the fastest ships in its class of all known races. Its speed, mobility and the 4 weapon mounts make this ship deadly, its effectiveness should never be underestimated.</t>
 <t id="3832">The Pirate Mandalay is the fastest of the Pirate ships. The Mandalay is the backbone for express transfers of cargo and also as an auxiliary escort to the Orinoco in conjunction with the Bayamon.</t>

 <t id="3911">SQUASH Mine Factory</t>
 <t id="3912">This factory produces the SQUASH mine, a small explosive device developed to blockade stations, trading routes and gates.(||) Although these devices can be handy to use against military targets, they are considered highly illegal by some races who have witnessed some of these weapons accidentally destroy merchant and civilian ships as they do not have friend or foe recognition.</t>
 <t id="3913">SQUASH Mine</t>
 <t id="3914">A very destructive mine. Typically used to protect important strategic locations. Beware: This mine does not have a friend foe recognition!</t>
 <t id="3921">Lasertower Factory</t>
 <t id="3922">This factory produces laser towers, developed to become the ultimate defence for all stations. With a powerful laser that only fits into laser towers these weapons are considered to be substantially advanced in comparison to previous forms of weaponry.(||) Laser towers have started to appear in all corners of known space as all races see just how useful these defences can be against small groups of raiders. The artificial intelligence on board these towers allow for them to identify when the station it is protecting comes under attack, it can then adjust its friend or foe system accordingly.</t>
 <t id="3923">Lasertower</t>
 <t id="3924">A defence installation typically found around stations or factories to help them against invaders.</t>
 <t id="3931">Drone Factory</t>
 <t id="3932">This production facility manufactures the fighter drone, a small autonomous device that when given orders will attack using its single laser weapon.(||) They are produced using the best in computer technology, artificial intelligence and laser weaponry. Pilots use these small drones not to cause considerable damage to an enemy ship, but to cause numerous distractions when being attacked. If used in numbers, fighter drones can be effective.</t>
 <t id="3933">Fighter Drone</t>

 <t id="3973">Transporter Device</t>
 <t id="3974">The transporter device is a development based on the remains of the jump drive first introduced with the Xperimental ship and reverse engineered by the best scientists of all races. Using this device you can get from one ship into another ship within a range of 5km without using your spacesuit.</t>
 <t id="3983">Jumpdrive</t>
 <t id="3984">The jump drive is a new development. This ultimate upgrade allows your ship to jump to far distant sectors immediately. To focus on a distant jump gate through many different sectors and through many other gates, it requires additional energy containers for every sector it has to cross.</t>

 <t id="4012">When the first system was attacked this was one of the two heavy ships observed. It is armed with 6 weapons that are visible. There have been reports of smaller class ships docking to this ship. Its function would lead us to believe that it is equivalent with a Carrier class ship, but nothing else is known at present.(||) Upon a close scan, it appeared to have a large cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="4022">This ship is extremely dangerous. Keeping your distance would be advised. A scout recorded a count of at least 18 weapons, 3 mounted on 6 turrets. It has not been confirmed yet if this is true. This ship also was present at the first encounter of which single-handedly destroyed two stations. It is approximately the equivalent of a Destroyer class ship.</t>
 <t id="4032">This ship first appeared in an assault party. It is the heaviest fighter class ship of this race. It is speculated that it is equivalent to an M3 class.(||) No pilots have yet survived to relay more information from a battlefield. It is rumoured that some ships though have been captured and are being investigated to extract alien technology</t>
 <t id="4042">This ship was first seen on a skirmish that took place recently. It is equivalent to an M4 class ship.(||) Shields and weaponry are Невідомий. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4052">This ship was the first that was encountered of this species. It is considered to be a Scout ship due to its speed and armament.(||) It is very agile and its flying observed in a group formation suggests that they are some type of insectoid or based on a Hive like behaviour and being controlled from one point. This theory has yet to be verified due to limited contact. Not much else is known about this ship</t>
 <t id="4062">This ship first appeared in an assault party. The ship is made up of an M3 Fighter and several smaller M5 Scout craft.(||) One theory is that the gateless jump drive this species operates needs multiple power generators to form a stable wormhole that allows for the jump into known territories, where they then Спліт to form a wing of fighters. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4082">The function of this alien station is not yet determined.(||) Even when scanned at close range by a cover operation, revealed inconsistent data and interference. Even under further analysis, nothing was able to be determined about its function.</t>
 <t id="4112">The Centaur is a new development from Аргон Shipwrights in Омікрон Ліри, the ship itself is larger than a Fighter or Small Transporter, but is much smaller than a Destroyer.(||) Centaur is a new breed of corvette Class craft, capable of carrying one M5 class ship. Armed with turrets capable of supporting heavy weaponry, faster than a Nova and with over 3 times the shield strength, this ship has a bright future ahead of it.</t>
 <t id="4132">When the long serving Аргон Elite was retired four jazuras ago, the Аргон military was left without an M3 fighter, that was until a group of Shipwrights in Омікрон Ліри put forward plans for a new type of ship. The Nova was born shortly afterwards, and after two jazuras of testing virtually all of the older Elite class ship have been replaced by this new craft.(||) Capable of holding powerful weaponry, and armed with an aft turret, the Nova is bound to serve the Аргон military for many jazuras to come.</t>
 <t id="4162">The purpose of the Express is to act as a passenger transporter for civilians wanting to travel between systems and stations.(||) This was always a problem as passengers travelled in converted Lifter class freighters. But when the lifter was retired from service, it was found the Mercury could not replace the job of transporting people. The Express was constructed by a group of Civilians at Аргон Prime out of old planetary transport hulls to transport its workers from one station to another in one go. The Аргон Shipyard saw the ship and became interested in its design, which was altered slightly to act as the newest passenger transport ship.</t>
 <t id="4172">Mercury is the latest addition to the Аргон Merchant Fleet, and it is a worthy successor to the Аргон Lifter. Armed with an aft turret for defensive purposes, and increased shield space, the Mercury is more than capable of defending itself.(||) Аргон shipwrights that developed this craft were more than proud when the first ship rolled off the production line at Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="4181">Federal Аргон Wharf</t>
 <t id="4182">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. The older version of the shipyards were brought back into service when the Аргон Shipyards became overworked building more, larger ships and new station classes. Wharfs are built to handle the construction of smaller ships, freighters, and corvettes.(||) It is also known that the Аргон Wharf is a hub of research and trade activity, when ships of other races are sold here, they are dismantled and researched, or sold back to the race to whom they belong. All Аргон Wharfs are heavily guarded by Аргон fighter patrols.</t>
 <t id="4212">The Boron Hydra is a new class of ship, corvettes were developed to give extra protection to large fleets of Transport craft, and to destroy any incoming missiles while the fighters dealt with the attacking vessels, a job that they still keep to this day as they are fast enough to keep up with a convoy.(||) It is also capable of holding one M5 class ship that can be used for various tasks.</t>
 <t id="4232">The Barracuda is a new development to replace the Eel. When the plans for the Barracuda were developed, it was made clear that the Eel was too out-dated. The Barracuda improved on the design with a new power generator. This then allowed for the weaponry to be upgraded and room for slightly increased cargo space and improved acceleration.(||) As the Barracuda is now in service the Eel is no longer supported by the Boron Navy.</t>
 <t id="4242">A Major design flaw in the Piranha, lead to it being decommissioned from service. After being left without a light fighter class, the Boron Navy commissioned the Mako, it has enlarged cargo space and speed when compared to the Piranha, but has similar weapon capacities.(||) The design is loosely based on that of the Barracuda, as it is the same team of designers who constructed both ships.</t>
 <t id="4262">The Manta used to be used for royal service only, transporting important personnel from one sector to another. But now the ship has been downgraded to carry Passengers between systems.(||) The ship itself is large enough to carry many people, equipped with state of the art entertainment systems and comfortable seating to give the passengers a safe journey. It is also able to carry a certain amount to laser weaponry for defence.</t>
 <t id="4281">Royal Boron Dry-dock</t>
 <t id="4282">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies, and the Boron dry-dock does not stray from this simple description. They build smaller craft so that the larger shipyards can handle the building of Stations and larger battleships and transporters.(||) Most smaller Boron Ships are born here when the local research and development team test their ships. Boron high standards mean that only 1 in 30 ships designed, are put into full service. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="4312">The Dragon is the new designed Corvette class ship of the Спліт, which had some problems during the test phase of the prototype. It is a very fast ship, with great weapon power.(||)The Dragon entered service a decade ago, only to be taken out again when the prototype ship exploded as it docked to a shipyard in Сімейна Гордість, destroying the structure and killing 500 people who were on board at the time. The Спліт spent a further 3 jazuras trying to find out why the ship exploded. A small fracture in the reactor was to blame, and when the reactor casing was re-designed the ship re-entered service, although many Спліт pilots consider the ship a curse.</t>
 <t id="4352">This ship is the successful replacement to the ageing Wolf that was in service since the Спліт first started to construct ships. The Jaguar is capable of increased speed and increased firepower to the expense of cargo space.(||) This ship is primarily used as a scout craft, due to its speed, mainly as it is unable to do anything more.</t>
 <t id="4362">This fast transport ship has been in service for many jazuras now. The ship was originally intended to be a Slave transport craft, which transported slaves from where they were captured to the factories where they would spend the rest of their tazuras.(||) Now the ship is used to transport personnel from sector to sector. It is armed with adequate weaponry, but its main defence is speed.</t>
 <t id="4372">The prototype replacement to the Mule, was nearly destroyed in the Dragon Incident, but it managed to save 100 people that were nearly killed as the docking crew tried to escape. The Caiman Project was continued in Поразка Чо where it was eventually finished, and put into service taking supplies to rebuild the Shipyard in Сімейна Гордість.(||) The ship is armed with a single turret and slightly faster than its predecessor.</t>
 <t id="4381">Спліт Dockyard</t>
 <t id="4382">An original Паранід Hard Labour Camp, designed to hold prisoners and to force them to build small craft for the Паранід Empire. This was to change when the Паранід built large Shipyards. After the Dragon Incident, it was decided to bring back these smaller independent shipyards for constructing smaller craft, where they could be tested and modified.(||) If an accident does occur again, the Спліт will have a separate station to fall on when they need to rebuild. You can usually find small craft, transporters and corvettes here, but not all ships can be found at every Dockyard.</t>
 <t id="4412">The Nemesis is the newest battleship to enter the Паранід Army; the ship is a small craft with the firepower of near to the level of a Carrier. Its defence consists of 2 Shield Slots, and capable of carrying Hornet Missiles. Its speed is to the equivalent of Fighters, which makes it capable of acting as a Bomber or as an Escort Ship.(||) It is capable of carrying one M5 craft, which can act as a transport or backup craft, as the nemesis can not dock with most stations.</t>
 <t id="4442">The Pericles was developed to replace the aging Poseidon. The Pericles improved on the earlier model by increasing shield capacity and the speed of the ship, while keeping the weapon compatibility.(||) The Pericles spent a long time in development as it had some structural flaws. These flaws were ironed out and the ship entered service to the sadness of the pilots who had become used to the sight of the Poseidon.</t>
 <t id="4462">The Hermes is based on an old original design for the Ganymede, but the design was re-worked to accommodate passengers. Like most Паранід ships it is able to hold a certain amount of weaponry, primarily for defence.(||) It is very unlikely you will see this ship in Аргон Systems, mainly as the tension between the two neighbours remains high.</t>
 <t id="4472">The Demeter has been used for some jazuras now, replacing the old Паранід Ganymede model, improving on all of its predecessors systems.(||) This ship was first brought into service to serve only the Паранід Fleet, but later slowly replaced the Ganymede because of their speed to bring the Паранід Economy back to levels of the Аргон and Boron.</t>
 <t id="4481">Паранід Pier</t>
 <t id="4482">The Паранід Pier is a small station built separate to a larger shipyard, unlike most other races these stations do not build the craft, but add the components to them before being sold, this is due to the construction process by the Паранід, the hulls of ships are built at the main shipyard then transported to the Pier where the rest of the ship is built.(||) This was done when docking at the original shipyards had a maximum of 6 stazuras wait to dock. This meant Паранід expansion into new territories took a long time. The Pier was designed and built within three mazuras from a spare equipment dock to handle the traffic of traders.</t>
 <t id="4512">The Osprey is a muddle of Аргон and original Теладі Technology, it was developed to become a long-range cargo transport craft, as it fits similar amounts of cargo to the Теладі Vulture.(||) The ship itself combines Shield and Weapon Compatibility to be one of the most deadly Теладі Craft currently in service. But its speed makes it one of the slowest craft of its class.</t>
 <t id="4542">The Buzzard was developed to replace the Теладі's most successful fighter; the Hawk. Buzzard improves on virtually everything about the ship. The main feature of the ship is the third shield slot and much improved acceleration.(||) Although the hawk was the pride of the Теладі Fighter Fleet, the Buzzard may just replace its good reputation.</t>
 <t id="4552">The Теладі Bat was considered to be the slowest M5 of its class, so it was retired and the Теладі Harrier replaced the ship. It is considered to be more profitable out of the two, although it has not improved on its speed very much.(||) As the Теладі Believe in profit the ships cargo bay has been extended to fit double the original capacity at the expense of shield space.</t>
 <t id="4562">The Toucan is a mid-range luxury passenger transport craft. Equipped with the necessary entertainment facilities to keep its passengers comfortable in its journey, from computerised gambling to up to the date visual entertainment, all in the confines of a luxury seat.(||) The ship itself can be armed, but lacks speed; it is known that this ship is the slowest of its class.</t>
 <t id="4581">Теладі Showroom</t>
 <t id="4582">The Теладі Showroom is exactly what it sounds like; small ships are transported here to be sold in luxurious surroundings.(||) Unlike other Теладі stations, Showrooms allow the buyer to view a ship before purchase; this was done when it was found that Теладі Ship Sales are only at 8% when all races sales are put together. After the Теладі opened up on their ships, the sales jumped higher. These stations were first placed in key Теладі Sectors, but soon expanded to other primary sectors. But buyers beware; the Теладі will try everything to get your money.</t>
 <t id="4621">Ion Disruptor Forge</t>
 <t id="4622">This forge manufactures the weapon known as the Ion Disruptor. This new weapon is considered to be more useful than powerful.(||) Manufacturing the weapon is a different matter, it is a complicated process, which involves creating a device able to create a stream of ionised particles. This itself is dangerous.</t>
 <t id="4623">Ion Disruptor</t>
 <t id="4624">This weapon is unlike any weapon encountered, developed by Boron Scientists, this weapon fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. Then the stream is ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, while leaving the hull relatively untouched.(||) Although this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps up to Boron standards.</t>
 <t id="4631">Mobile Drilling System Factory</t>
 <t id="4632">This factory manufactures the Mobile Drilling System which is used to break up ore-rich asteroids into smaller pieces without the need for a stationary mining facility.</t>
 <t id="4633">Mobile Drilling System</t>
 <t id="4634">The Mobile Drilling System accelerates and emits small fast rotating helical particles which drill into rock and use supersonic resonance to break up the rock. Its effectiveness against other materials is very low.</t>

 <t id="4671">Alpha PSG Forge</t>
 <t id="4672">This forge manufactures the Alpha PSG weapon, a new breakthrough in weaponry technology.(||) The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires job specific machinery. Safety is also an issue, the prototype station exploded when the main matter compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has changed.</t>
 <t id="4673">Alpha Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
 <t id="4674">This weapon was developed in conjunction between the Теладі and Паранід. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave of phased energy.(||) This weapon has many uses, many of which can be quite useful, one is missile defence.</t>
 <t id="4681">Beta PSG Forge</t>

 <t id="4731">Xperimental Shuttle</t>
 <t id="4732">Not much is known about the ship known as the Xperimental Shuttle. This ship was supposed to be able to cross vast distances without having to use jump gates, by generating its own wormhole. Аргон Scientists are still trying to fix the ship and get its drive back into working order.(||) When the ship was built it was considered to be the fastest ship of its class. It also attracted the attention of people when it landed on stations, as this ship is unique.</t>
 <t id="4741">Space Suit</t>
 <t id="4742">This technologically advanced space suit keeps the wearer warm, shields from radiation and offers some manoeuvrability, but gives little protection against laser weapons.</t>
 <t id="4752">The Гонер ship is the only ship known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the goners this ship holds no weaponry. The ship is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters.(||) You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and R.Gunne.</t>
 <t id="4761">Advanced Satellite</t>
 <t id="4762">{17,4814}</t>
 <t id="4771">Camera Drone</t>
 <t id="4772">{17,4804}</t>
 <t id="4803">Camera Drone</t>
 <t id="4804">New on the public market, developed by the Аргон military to receive accurate tactical information on its neighbours. The Camera Drone has been updated over the last decade to incorporate the newest in video capture technology to feed live information to the person who remotely controls the device.(||) Today the device is used to survey new sectors and planets, as well as spying on neighbours and monitoring enemy activities.</t>
 <t id="4811">Advanced Satellite Factory</t>
 <t id="4812">This stations manufactures Advanced Satellites. Additionally to the common Navigation Relay Satellite Advanced Satellites feature video capture technology. The factory uses delicate machinery to build these complicated small devices.(||) With the invention of sending information through the gate network, satellites were developed to assist in boosting these transmissions, scientists later added a small sensor network to the satellites to assist in navigation and long range managing of stations.</t>
 <t id="4813">Advanced Satellite</t>
 <t id="4814">This satellite is the next generation of advanced communications. This satellite allows for video capture technology, a new feature that was developed to keep an eye on stations and ships.(||) This Satellite still has the old features that allow for navigation and information relay transfer.</t>
 <t id="4823">Ore Collector</t>
 <t id="4824">After Ore has been broken up by a mobile drilling system, the smaller rocks can be brought into the cargo bay using this new device. It works by targeting the smaller rocks with a low powered gravity beam, bringing the ore into the bay ready to be sold.</t>
 <t id="4833">Camouflage Device</t>
 <t id="4834">This is a specialised device originally developed for spy missions by the Паранід, the technology behind the device is Невідомий. It renders the ship invisible to gravidar and to sight. Because of its dangerous nature it is now considered highly illegal in most sectors as there are fears that if the device falls into either Pirate or Ксенон hands, any of the sentient races would be at risk to attack.(||) Although there are rumours that each race military has a covert operations squadron equipped these devices.</t>
 <t id="4863">Spacefly Collector</t>
 <t id="4864">Although illegal, Spacefly collecting has become the highly paid good in the universe. These small creatures are captured by a high resonance wave of the device, attracting them inside of hold.(||) These spaceflies are then sold to anyone who will take them, automatically making a profit. This activity is illegal but within pirate communities it has become a way of life.</t>
 <t id="4871">Alpha PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4872">Originally a Weapons Research Laboratory for Аргон scientists, now home to the production of the Photon Pulse Cannon. A powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4873">Alpha Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4874">First developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Аргон, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the Аргон Military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation.</t>
 <t id="4881">Beta PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4882">An upgraded PPC Forge, the Beta Version is more powerful with a longer construction process. The PPC is a powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4883">Beta Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4884">The next version of the PPC series first developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Аргон. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation, this version also includes a super conducting coil set.</t>
 <t id="4891">Gamma PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4892">The Most powerful PPC weapon is constructed here. A fully upgraded Forge with autonomous machinery to construct the most deadly Capital Weapon to Date.</t>
 <t id="4893">Gamma Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4894">The most powerful version of the PPC series first developed by Professor Jo Bydnah. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, which multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. A proton filter makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields, allowing the weapon to react with the hull.</t>
 <t id="4903">Sting</t>
 <t id="4913">Needle</t>
 <t id="4923">Thorn</t>
 <t id="4932">The Perseus is the successor to the Prometheus. Its first test run was considered an embarrassment to the Паранід as it was stolen by a Pirate, leading to their request for external help to recover it.(||) The ship was initially tested with shields used for corvette ships but they wrecked havoc with some of the internal systems so they were changed for above standard sizes.</t>
 <t id="4941">Lasertower Weapon Forge</t>
 <t id="4942">This factory produces the lasertower weapon. This weapon is incompatible with all ships. It can only be used in the lasertower defence platform.(||) The station uses high tech machinery to assemble this weapon, it is a very dangerous process which uses plasma energy.</t>
 <t id="4943">Lasertower Weapon</t>
 <t id="4944">This is the primary high-energy plasma beam that is used in Lasertowers. Its main energy systems make this weapon incompatible with large ships for the time being(||), although scientists are trying to find a way to remedy this situation.(||) Аргон scientists first developed this weapon by accident when using a photon enhanced Gamma radiation, which created a beam laser.</t>
 <t id="4951">Mass Driver Forge</t>
 <t id="4952">Mass Drivers are a new invention by the Аргон and Спліт. It makes use of the magnetic firing system that allows the projectile to be fired out at rapid speed without the need for chemical or laser based firing systems. Projectiles are bought separately and are sold in Ammunition Crates.</t>
 <t id="4953">Mass Driver</t>
 <t id="4954">This weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi barrelled cannon, which is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.(||) It inflicts damage not due power of individual projectiles but because of the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the unique nature of this weapon's ammunition it has almost no effect on a ship's shields but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain due to the fact that its ammunition supplies all energy requirements. Currently the weapon can only be fitted to Аргон and Спліт ships as they are the only ships that can accommodate the ammunition feed system. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition.</t>
 <t id="4961">Ammunition Factory</t>
 <t id="4962">This factory is devoted to the creation and distribution of Ammunition for the Mass Driver weapon.(||) Projectiles are created for hardened steel, which is produced on the station. Each projectile is then put into feed crates that are sold and are placed directly into the Mass Driver weapon system.</t>
 <t id="4963">Mass Driver Ammunition</t>
 <t id="4964">This is special ammunition for use in the Mass Driver. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself and a small armour piercing shell which is then encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered, by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy. This pack contains 200 rounds.</t>
 <t id="4971">TerraCorp Headquarters</t>
 <t id="4972">This is the most important station belonging to the TerraCorp Company based in Home of Light. Parts of this facility are open to the public, although most of the station is closed to personnel only. These include research facilities and company offices. A range of technology can be found here, and some rare devices that are only offered by one particular race. Materials are often required and are bought by the TerraCorp Company for a fair price.(||) A small fleet of ships can usually be found nearby making the station highly guarded. The station also incorporates state of the art recreation and commerce facilities, including Hotels, Sport Domes, Cinemas and Restaurants. Most races are welcome here to trade.</t>

 <t id="5051">Navigational Beacon</t>
 <t id="5052">Hazard Warning Beacons are placed by civilian militias to mark out the trade routes in dangerous sectors, they emit pulses of light that show the trade lanes between gates and stations.(||) By flying close to these beacons you can be assured of a safe flight, although Пірат sometimes use these trade routes as target practice.</t>
 <t id="5061">Federal Аргон Installation</t>
 <t id="5062">This installation can be found across Аргон Territory near to zones of war, or the edges of their territory. It is heavily guarded with several squadrons of fighters and military transport craft. Access can be granted to some traders so they can upgrade their ships or even join the Federal Аргон Police Militias.(||) Built using the same design station as the Аргон trade docks, the installations interior however does not resemble these popular stations. They have military testing ranges and fighter research facilities.</t>
 <t id="5071">Royal Boron Research Station</t>
 <t id="5072">This design of station is credited with coming across great finds. The facility researches anything from weapons and ships to archaeology and medical equipment.(||) It can usually be found in orbit of planets with a high scientific interest. With several squadrons of the best boron fighters, this station is heavily guarded. Traders can come to this station to bring food and supplies to this station.</t>
 <t id="5081">Паранід Communications Facility</t>
 <t id="5082">This station is an adapted dock whose main purpose is to monitor and keep track of all forms of communication. Normal traders are allowed on board to trade in its limited cargo space where one can find all forms of communication equipment, ranging from Advanced Satellites to the basic communication equipment.(||) Some other goods can also be traded here if in surplus or if needed by the stations civilian and military crew. Most sections of this station on one hand are out of bounds.</t>
 <t id="5091">Аргон One</t>
 <t id="5092">{17,3112}</t>
 <t id="5111">Аргон Merchant Scrapyard</t>
 <t id="5112">This station is run by civilian Scrap Merchants. They deal in old ship hulls that are no longer space worthy.(||) Whenever a ship is cashed in, the customer will get a fair shipment of ore from the Merchants in return. The rest of the materials are kept by the scrapyard to be sold later, be used for other purposes or disposed off. The stations cargo bays are usually filled with hulks of old ships that are yet to be processed, some could be repaired, while others are too badly damaged.</t>

 <t id="5203">Artefacts</t>
 <t id="5204">Relics of ancient civilisations can be found all over the universe. These artefacts vary in size and shape, but most were built with sophisticated advanced technology. The origins of these artefacts is still unclear and Аргон and Boron archaeologists are working to decipher their purpose.</t>
 <t id="5213">Artificial Fertilizer</t>
 <t id="5214">In recent jazuras the Аргон Agriculture Council has decided that it is unsafe to use Natural Fertilizer from the Argnu Cattle. This artificial fertiliser created by the AAC contains all the essential elements that plants need for growth, but eliminates the ones that are harmful to other life-forms.</t>
 <t id="5223">Biological Micro-Organisms</t>
 <t id="5224">These micro-organisms are used by the Boron to create new and advanced pharmaceuticals.(||) Using their advanced genetic techniques, the Boron have discovered many cures to previously incurable diseases. The regulation of these micro-organisms is now controlled in most sectors by the Boron Medical Council. The Boron actively search out new species and have discovered varieties that are used to manufacture fertilizer and to treat radioactive waste.</t>
 <t id="5233">Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="5234">Designed and produced by the military, these cartography chips contain important information on individual sectors or the universe as a whole. They detail the positions of all known military facilities and stellar phenomena.</t>
 <t id="5243">Construction Equipment</t>
 <t id="5244">Modern construction equipment is designed to allow the construction of vast space stations safely and quickly. It is vital for the economic growth of all races.</t>
 <t id="5253">Engine Components</t>
 <t id="5254">Engine components are used in the manufacture and repair of spacecraft engines. The plasma drive is the most common engine system used in modern spacecraft.(||) It makes use of a high energy ionised plasma stream from a fusion core to propel the ship. These drives are very stable and simple in construction and need little maintenance.</t>
 <t id="5263">Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="5264">Entertainment chips contain films, books, or interactive entertainment. They are used all throughout the known universe. Many Boron titles, however, have been banned in the Спліт sectors.</t>
 <t id="5273">Food Rations</t>
 <t id="5274">Small packs of food usually used in combat or refugee conditions.(||) These packs of food contain freeze-dried Argnu beef, dried BoFu and water rations. Although not appetizing, these foods can mean the difference between life and starvation.</t>
 <t id="5283">Hand Weapons</t>
 <t id="5284">There are many different designs of hand weapons to allow for the physical capabilities of each race. They range from Knives and swords to sophisticated military guns and rifles.</t>
 <t id="5293">Luxury Foodstuffs</t>
 <t id="5294">Many planets produce they own Luxury Foodstuffs that are coveted by connoisseurs all over the universe.(||) They are packed into refrigerated boxes and shipped quickly to their destination. Because of the cost and short shelf-life these foodstuffs are usually only used at important functions.</t>
 <t id="5303">Medical Equipment</t>
 <t id="5304">Medical equipment can be found all over the universe. This equipment can range from small medicinal bottles to life support systems and portable operating theatres.</t>
 <t id="5313">Mining Equipment</t>
 <t id="5314">Mining Equipment, produced by the Galactic Mining Authority, is used to repair or replace equipment on Asteroid Mines. The equipment ranges from the standard mining drill to advanced laser equipment.</t>
 <t id="5323">Nividium</t>
 <t id="5324">Nividium is a rare mineral that is found in some larger asteroid fields located in the universe. Its use is limited, although it has been used as a superconductor. Nividium in its purest form is traded as a unique and valuable commodity.</t>
 <t id="5333">Radioactive Waste</t>
 <t id="5334">Radioactive waste is by-product of weapon production, especially the Hornet Missile.(||) Until recently the only way to dispose off the waste was to dump it in disused silicon mines. The Boron have discovered a micro-organism in the sector Light Water that digests the harmful waste and excretes a inert material. How this useful radiation resistant organism evolved is Невідомий.</t>
 <t id="5343">Teladianium Panelling</t>
 <t id="5344">Teladianium panelling as produced in rolling mills at shipyards and when added to a ship's hull provides extra protection from space borne particles.</t>
 <t id="5353">Water</t>
 <t id="5354">Water is transported in large gas free containers all over the universe.(||) Many sectors have few natural sources of water and have to transport their requirements for drinking and cleaning. In these sectors the water supply is the most important commodity.</t>
 <t id="5363">Weapon Interface Chips</t>
 <t id="5364">More commonly known as WICs, these weapon interface chips are used in large laser based weapons. They are an interface between the ships computer and weapon, designed to help regulate the energy flow and to prevent illegal modification. Weapons can not operate without these chips.</t>
 <t id="5373">Narcotics</t>
 <t id="5374">Narcotics are used widely within the pirate community. These drugs alter the person's perceptions and brain functions.(||) Unfortunately these effects cannot be controlled and the narcotics can usually result in unwanted side effects and in some cases death.</t>
 <t id="5383">Super Slave Chips</t>
 <t id="5384">Slave chips are a neural implant that is used to allow pilots of spacecraft to have direct control over his or her ship.(||) The Super Slave has better range using the same hub technology, improved perception, longer use and most importantly a built in fail safe device.</t>
 <t id="5393">Spacefly Eggs</t>
 <t id="5394">The eggs of the Markus Spacefly are very rarely found. It is believed that they lay their eggs in hollow asteroids when conditions are correct. Unfortunately it has become popular to collect unhatched eggs as they are very decorative with colourful patterns.(||) Trade in these items is illegal and any trader caught can expect a lengthy prison sentence.</t>
 <t id="5403">Pirate Sidearms</t>
 <t id="5404">Unlike the military issue hand weapons, these Pirate sidearms have been declared illegal by most races. They are popular amongst Пірат as they are very effect at short range and even minor wounds can be fatal.(||) The favoured pirate sidearm is the rare IMB-42 Blaster which literally rips the molecular structure of a living organism apart. Transportation and owning these weapons is a capital offence in some sectors.</t>
 <t id="5413">Hackerchips</t>
 <t id="5414">A new and expensive computer chip created by some raider parties. These Hacker chips are designed as an adaptive hacking tool, automatically redirecting signals, creating viruses and generally making a hacker's life easier.(||) They are easily identifiable because they contain their own power source - a small fusion battery that powers the chip for a Jazura.</t>
 <t id="5423">Military Personnel</t>
 <t id="5424">The military always have to move personnel around at short notice. For this purpose they often employ freelance pilots. These passengers usually carry weapons and other goods and their destinations might be dangerous.</t>
 <t id="5433">Passengers</t>
 <t id="5434">All races have access to commercial space craft, these ships can take large groups of passengers to space stations or to other planets or systems.</t>
 <t id="5443">Very Important Passengers</t>
 <t id="5444">A very special passenger with very special requirements for travelling. They usually have several security guards and travel with a large amount of luggage.</t>
 <t id="5453">Duplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5454">Research and development of the Gravidar technology has resulted in the Duplex Scanner, which increases the scanners range by a factor of 2. This enables targets to be acquired at much greater range.</t>
 <t id="5463">Triplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5464">The Triplex scanner increases the Gravidar scanner range by a factor of 3. The technology used detects greater variations in the gravitational anomalies that are generated by stations.(||) This information is then processed and fed directly to both the sector map and the Gravidar display.</t>

<page id="19" title="Sectordescription" descr="Long descriptions of all sectors" voice="0">
 <t id="1030101">This sector contains one of the most varied selections of products in the known universe. Equipment, raw materials, ship upgrades and installations of many types can be traded here in a relatively secure environment. This is the Boron home world and a place of quiet contemplation and study.</t>
 <t id="1030102">The Boron produce high quality electronics and semi-organic computer systems as well as more conventional goods in this large and crowded sector. The supporting factories produce a wealth of raw materials for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030103">This sector provides cheap, clean power to all the Boron sectors. The Boron's ecologically sensitive ideology requires all power used in Boron sectors, even planetary power supplies, to be produced space-side.</t>
 <t id="1030104">The Boron and Теладі trade amicably in this peaceful sector. As with all Boron sectors, the economy is heavily reliant on agriculture and imported raw materials. The beguiling organic shapes of Boron Space Trading Stations are a constant reminder of their aquatic origins.</t>
 <t id="1030105">On the border between Теладі and Boron space, this system acts as a major commercial centre for trade between the Foundation and Profit Guilds, as well as providing large amounts of raw mineral resources. Although the Спліт rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Теладі. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the Більший Прибуток of the Теладі of course.</t>
 <t id="1030106">Once the favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector is now managed by the Теладі and has become the preferred destination of fun seekers, weedheads and space-hippies of every race. The Bliss Place in the centre of the sector produces the narcotic spaceweed, the meditative drug of choice for the dreamers, artists and neo-philosophers that are drawn here.</t>
 <t id="1030107">On the Спліт-Теладі border, this sector is the focal point for much of the limited trade between the Спліт and other species. The two Теладі systems between Сім'я Ві and the nearest Boron system provide a buffer between the two feuding species. It is usual, however, to find Спліт on guard against the unlikely threat of a Boron sneak attack.</t>
 <t id="1030114">While the Теладі Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector may choose to disagree. Сховище is a system hard to reach by normal means, this sector contains nothing but high tech stations. Сховище is also home to the Теладі Company's main research facility, always trying to improve upon current technology. Whilst this sector is relatively new, it is thought that it will be expanded further with new ship design and construction facilities. Work has already begun here on a replacement for the aging heavy freighters employed by Теладі traders.</t>
 <t id="1030117">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030118">Discovered while exploring Гетсу Ф'юне, this sector was cleared of Ксенон by a small force of ships, unfortunately soon after this mission was completed the Аргон destroyer was ambushed. Its Captain's last report stated that the Ксенон entered the sector from an unexplored gate, the position of which was not recorded. The Destroyer was never heard from again. The sector has rarely been entered since and is considered by the Аргон to be somewhat cursed in its nature.</t>
 <t id="1030120">The existence of this sector was thought to be little more than a legend. That was until a lone Boron pilot, crazed with fear and exhaustion, was picked up in the Menelaus Paradise sector. He died shortly after rescue, babbling desperately about an eternal cosmic horror buried deep in the skin of a 'dark planet'. Since then Аргон spy probes have been sent in to investigate; as of yet, no discovery has been made public.</t>
 <t id="1030201">On the border of Аргон and Boron space the populated planets of this system are a popular vacation destination for Аргон high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings. The very best in Аргон cuisine is made in this system. The Equipment Dock provides a wide choice of weapons and upgrades for combat ships and pleasure-cruisers alike.</t>
 <t id="1030202">Sometime before the last Ксенон conflict the planet 'Shipfall' was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Аргон industrial colony. Some effort has been made to re-establish the colony since, but its activities are currently restricted mainly to mining and agriculture.</t>
 <t id="1030203">This sector was once occupied by the Аргон Federation's largest station, the Antigone. It was attacked in 215 by the largest Ксенон fleet known to date. The station launched its defence fleet when one of the Ксенон ships fired into the docking bays, destroying several fighter wings and setting off a chain reaction from damaged propulsion systems in the process. The station was destroyed, killing thousands of people. Some crew and visitors managed to make it out through emergency escape pods that were recovered once the Ксенон had retreated. In one of the largest recovery efforts ever made by the Аргон, medevac ships were dispatched to assist. One of these, the Springbird, was attacked while leaving the sector, forcing it into the atmosphere of the planet 'Sandwell'. All contact was subsequently lost. The recovery operation was extended to find survivors on the planet surface, none were ever located, perhaps due to the scorching heat from the local star. The outpost has now become a place of remembrance for the many Аргон who travel here to honour their war dead.</t>
 <t id="1030204">This system supplies most of the weaponry used by the Boron Military in their sporadic battles against the Спліт, in addition to the defence of their systems from Pirate and Ксенон raiders. As it is the main supply and outfitting depot for the Boron space-fleet, it is a prime target for Спліт attacks should hostilities resume between the two species.</t>
 <t id="1030205">The factory and refinery workers of Частка Прибутку are renowned for working hard - and partying even harder. The Bliss place can be rough at a cycle's end - on refinery pay-day when the dice are loaded and the stakes are high, tempers can get frayed. The smokeshacks and speakeasies of Частка Прибутку are commonly frequented by the more colourful Pirate crews.</t>
 <t id="1030206">With a wealth of untapped mineral resources and busy commercial and industrial installations, trade in the Теладі's home system is potentially very lucrative. Although well policed, the wealth of this system attracts opportunistic Pirate activity. To guard the profit of the many, a Теладі Destroyer often stands guard over this sector.</t>
 <t id="1030207">This system provides the Спліт with a wide variety of food and raw materials as well as being the production centre for their heavy ship's Pulse Beam Lasers. Far from the 'wild space' this system is relatively safe from pirate attack although occasional skirmishes are reported.</t>
 <t id="1030214">A highly defended system, for reasons that only the Теладі and few others know about. Shareholders Fortune is a new sector developed around a small field of large asteroids. The Теладі believed that this system would provide them with a source of Nividium, a rare material found in only some parts of the universe. After they found out their research ship was incorrect in this assumption the Теладі had to turn to building new factories for high-demand technologies.</t>
 <t id="1030215">When the Теладі Mining Executive came across this system, they sent several of their Explorer Ships to evaluate the systems resources. One of the ships, the Mercantile, came across abandoned space stations set into some of the mineral-rich asteroids. The technology seemed to be similar to the Аргон, however they denied ever having held a presence there. The neighbouring system already belonged to the Теладі, so they quickly moved in, re-aligning the gates with the standard navigation system, near to the alien mines. After retrofitting the stations with Теладі technology, the largest Теладі mining operation in history opened for business.</t>
 <t id="1030218">This very remote system was discovered several Jazuras ago by chance by an adventurer. The governments of the individual races could not agree on who should administer this system in the future. In order to underline their own requirement in this area of space each race built space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Спліт, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition period as independent administrator of this region. Each government also sent their own space workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, and even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, in which another female star warrior found her way into the X Universe. The system is now under administration by the Terracorp, who are starting to bring in their own stations and occupy empty spaces within the commerce grid.</t>
 <t id="1030219">The planet 'Oceania' is a huge world enveloped in swirling coloured mists and encircled with spectacular dust rings. It is a popular meditative resort for Boron monks who spend weeks in isolation in the planet's aquatic wilderness to contemplate the purpose and meaning of life. The installations here service these pilgrims' basic needs.</t>
 <t id="1030220">Although many ships have been sent to survey this sector, few have returned. Once shunned by all the sentient species, last surveillance records show the system was home to a pirate base that the Ксенон constantly placed under attack. Pirate forces set this base up in search of easy pickings when the Ксенон fleet jumped to the neighbouring grid 596, only to find the Ксенон returned a few wozuras later. With access to the gate blocked, evacuation attempts were futile, leaving them with no option except to hold their position. Their survival in this sector is still a case for much debate.</t>
 <t id="1030301">This system is sparsely populated, dedicated purely to the production of raw materials and food for installations in the surrounding systems. The presence of weapons production facilities requires heavy protection by Federation ships against sabotage attacks from Пірат seeking to weaken Аргон defences.</t>
 <t id="1030302">The Аргон mine workers in this mineral rich system are famed across space for their ability to consume vast quantities of Space Fuel. Their semi-legal bootlegging operation keeps the miners happy and the bosses rich. Strong liquor loosens tongues and the system is a hive of gossip, rumour and dubious scuttlebuzz.</t>
 <t id="1030303">This Аргон system's economy is heavily reliant on trade between the Аргон and their Boron allies. The Foundation Guild has its Headquarters here and the Trading Station is the temporary seat of the newly founded Boron Chamber of Commerce. The many cattle ranches here supply Argnu Beef for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030304">The planet 'Tethys' has a huge population and the Boron are determined to protect the billions living there from the dangerous lawlessness of nearby 'uncivilised' systems. The local economy is very reliant on import of raw materials - most notably Teladianium which is required by the many Bio-Gas Factories.</t>
 <t id="1030305">This system is jealously guarded by the Теладі as it contains scarce organic and mineral resources. The seas of Phobass IV produce kilometre high waves - the best surfing in the universe bar none! The system has a thriving tourist trade based mainly on Boron day-trips to the Planet's many underwater resorts.</t>
 <t id="1030306">A relatively safe system, ideal for short trading runs and a debut in factory ownership. The Sun Oil Refineries in this system and more in the surrounding systems are reliant on imported sunrise flowers - making this an ideal location for a Solar Power Plant and Dream Farm.</t>
 <t id="1030307">Thuruks Pride produces a lot of the complex computers and hardware required by Спліт warships. Plentiful and cheap energy, and a variety of natural raw materials make this system a lucrative high-tech manufacturing center. Спліт and Паранід technology are combined in this sector to produce efficient and powerful beam weapons.</t>
 <t id="1030308">The home system of the Спліт, Сімейна Гордість is a major resupply point for the Спліт military as well as having a bustling civilian commercial district. Its primary planet houses the HQ of the Council of All Families - the martial government that rules over Спліт affairs.</t>
 <t id="1030310">Originally discovered and claimed by the Спліт Patriarch as a hideaway, this sector is now a thriving commercial colony. It is from here that the Спліт Patriarch ordered his forces to repel the attacks from the rebelling Сім'я Ронкар. In the final tazuras of the war, this sector was made impenetrable with three of the Patriarch's latest prototype destroyers. They managed to defend the sector with their armament of 20 plasma throwers per ship. The Rhonkar family eventually found a way around this blockade. They sent in a small fleet of heavy fighters that made a successful kamikaze run against the command vessel and destroyed it. Then a combined Rhonkar - Njy fleet attacked, eliminating the other two prototypes. The Patriarch was captured and deposed. The plans of these prototypes were lost in battle.</t>
 <t id="1030315">The border of Теладі and Спліт space in this part of the universe is located in this system. Trade between the Теладі and the Спліт Families T'kr and Njy usually takes place in this oddly designed system. Arranged by the Паранід sector designer, Almanckessat, this systems arrangement is thought to bring forth good fortune, to which the Паранід claim a great deal of in the name of their empire, much to the chagrin of the Теладі, to whom Дім Можливості is the capital of their local sectors.</t>
 <t id="1030319">This small Boron outpost produces mineral products as well as the highly regarded Stotts Spices. It has attracted little hostile attention so far. The Boron tolerate the Спліт using this system as a convenient route to unexplored space in return for safe passage of Boron craft through certain Спліт systems.</t>
 <t id="1030401">This outpost of basic installations acts as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area. It produces only the basic products most required by small ships and installations. The system is the spiritual home of the popular Аргон sport known as 'Hardball'.</t>
 <t id="1030402">Bathed in the sacred light of the sun 'Sonra', the Аргон home system is dominated by the planet 'Аргон Prime'. This rich and beautiful world is densely populated and is usually protected by a large Аргон Military force, a Titan Destroyer and more recently the Аргон's latest flagship carrier, the Аргон One, a Colossus class Carrier. Most of the needs of the Аргон space fleet are catered for here in orbiting shipyards that also outfit private fighters and transport ships with Аргон technology.</t>
 <t id="1030403">This system provides much needed power and food to the Аргон Military as well as providing a convenient temporary HQ for the rapid response squads set up against Pirate activity and Ксенон insurgence. It is often used as a base to recharge long range recon ships and carriers and as a result is a well defended and often dangerous system during times of conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030404">Originally discovered and declared lifeless by the earth science vessel 'Winterblossom', under the command of Rene Farnham, this system is now a lawless community of high-tech criminals. The illegal computer and weapons systems covertly built here are renowned for innovation if not reliability. None of which you will find publicly available. The hackers and cyberpunks who operate here are notoriously paranoid and are heavily guarded by armed enforcers.</t>
 <t id="1030405">Deep in unclaimed space this system is little more than a long established and well respected ambush. Rogue Теладі and Аргон stations provide cover for aggressive Pirate strike forces. A single, cratered moon holds the wrecks of many of the ships disabled, stripped and left to fall to its surface by freebooters, hullcutters and privateers.</t>
 <t id="1030406">A busy and lucrative system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Блакитний Прибуток is most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Теладі factory workers. Combining Теладі reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Аргон and Теладі percussion instruments, 'Теладі Blues' is appreciated by many sentient species.</t>
 <t id="1030407">The powerful Rhonkar Family runs this large Спліт weapons outpost. It is a heavily industrialized system with a lack of warmth and lays emphasis on functionality that is common to all Спліт space installations. Rhonkar Family warriors patrol their property efficiently and deal with unwanted guests with little courtesy.</t>
 <t id="1030408">This sparse system is primarily dedicated to the production of food. The Rastar Oil refineries rely on pirate stations for their supplies of space flies and import all other raw materials from outside the system. A dense, mineral-rich asteroid field fills the whole system. Спліт superstition forbids mining on the largest of these asteroids, claiming them to be cursed.</t>
 <t id="1030409">Prevented by the Аргон from invading Boron territory, the Спліт have set out to colonising the space around their own systems. Сонце Тарка was the first of these new colonies, its mineral resources and agricultural plants providing raw materials for the Спліт push into new systems.</t>
 <t id="1030410">The Спліт secured this mineral rich system from the Ксенон rearguard early after the last Ксенон conflict but sustained heavy losses doing so. It now exists as a welcome, if rough, trading post on a busy route between many species' systems. Few communities hate the Ксенон more than the inhabitants of this system.</t>
 <t id="1030415">This sector is home to the disgraced family T'kr, who were held responsible for a tragic incident that destroyed a Спліт shipyard and killed five hundred Спліт. What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was, the then Patriarch of All Спліт, using T'kr as a sign to all Спліт that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it has been only in recent jazuras that the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also marks the border for the Теладі 'fortune' system block. Three sectors that the Теладі use for production, and also contain the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system.</t>
 <t id="1030416">Once owned by the T'kr Family, this was a hub of activity. Mining was the main job here, but after the Dragon Incident this sector was seized by the neighbouring Njy family under orders form the Patriarch of all Спліт. Now the sector has run into disrepair, new stations have been built but are poorly maintained, pirate activity has increased and remnants of a minefield placed by T'kr to stop the seizure of the system can be found hidden in nebula streams. Pilots are asked to take caution in this system, as these mines could still be operational.</t>
 <t id="1030417">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further in this area of space this Спліт colony is heavily guarded and produces surveillance equipment and defensive weapons, allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. A covert Federation intelligence group in turn watch the Спліт for signs of aggression against the peace loving Boron.</t>
 <t id="1030418">Located next to Спліт space this system is usually on a knife edge of tension. The Boron have no military presence here lest they give the Спліт an excuse to attack and instead rely on the covert intelligence and good will of other species to dissuade the Спліт from aggression.</t>
 <t id="1030419">This system was the centre of the Ксенон weapons test zone during the last conflict. The system's planet was blown apart by an experimental weapon, probably the rumoured 'Galaxy Killer' device - used to vapourise and ignite the still burning 'Hadesfire Nebulae'. It is now a laid-back Boron mining and farming colony.</t>
 <t id="1030501">The Аргон military have taken full advantage of the rich resources in this area. Competition is fierce with many companies all competing for business. There are still profit opportunities, however, in mining for the export market. The station here acts as a resupply point for Аргон Military fighters and a good selection of surplus weapon systems can be found there.</t>
 <t id="1030502">Scattered in the shadow of the now terraformed planet 'Kho's Haven', this recently re-colonised system's installations are mainly concerned with the production of high quality electronics and fabrics. Lax security arrangements make this system a favourite route for Pirate raiding parties looking for richer pickings.</t>
 <t id="1030503">Now little more than a smouldering shell, Presidents End stands testament to the ferocity of the Хаак. What little remains here has been left untouched, a silent memorial and burial ground to the countless souls who lost their lives, unable to escape this sector's final demise. With gates that link to areas that hold even greater anarchy, Аргон security patrols struggle to maintain any semblance of control over the sector. Plans to rebuild are still held back by the fear of further reprisals. Perhaps in time Presidents End will see a new beginning, until then, this sector remains in mourning. </t>
 <t id="1030504">Despite the impression of respectability afforded to this system through the honoured name of Elena Kho, this asteroid-strewn colony is a favourite haunt of cut-throats, smugglers, wrecksweepers and hullcutters. The system has come to be a reliable, if illegal, source of controlled and specialized weaponry.</t>
 <t id="1030505">Weapons are required by many of the hidden outposts and illicit operations in unclaimed space. This system provides some of the necessary supplies and is protected by both a covert Pirate presence and a thick asteroid field. The mineral content of these asteroids is likely to cause a conflict between the smugglers and the legitimate mining corporations sooner or later.</t>
 <t id="1030506">Highly destructive PAC/PPC Weapons are built here under strict Теладі Military guard. Most of the personnel in this system are tied to the military arm of the Profit Guild or the smaller Теладі Company Navy. The market for recreational and luxury goods is high among those personnel on guard detail in a relatively safe system.</t>
 <t id="1030507">This system is the property of the Rhonkar Family, one of the dominant Спліт clans. Although this system was not always their property, it was seized during the last civil war with the Patriarch of all Спліт. Success here is ensured by slave labour, illegal mining methods and ruthless workforce control, this is not a matter that concerns the average Спліт.</t>
 <t id="1030510">Situated in a heavy asteroid belt this forbidding Спліт mining colony has grown into the second capital system of Спліт space. It is a successful trading location as well as providing much needed support for Спліт military ships. Run by the relatively liberal Thi Family this is the only Спліт system not using forced labour in its factories.</t>
 <t id="1030511">Established at the same time as 'New Income' this well organised Теладі system supports most of the ships travelling through newly colonised Теладі space. The inhospitable, rocky moon on the fringes of this system is used as a survival training ground for Теладі Company Profit-Protection troops.</t>
 <t id="1030517">This agricultural system is run by the brutally efficient Njy family. It produces many Спліт foodstuffs that are shipped to the two planets in this system and neighbouring systems. The Njy family is particularly brutal, offensive and arrogant, even by Спліт standards.</t>
 <t id="1030518">This system used to belong to the Спліт Family Ryk, but after a dispute with the Сім'я Ню, was taken in a rather strange battle. Njy outfitted some of their freighters with large explosives and changed their transmitter signal to say they were from Сім'я Ві, they later sent a distress signal saying they were under attack by Пірат. The Ryk Family Carrier came in to assist the freighters that were near the west gate, but when it was in range each of the six freighters simultaneously exploded, heavily damaging the carrier. Njy then moved in their destroyers and attacked the Ryk's military forces, destroying the carrier with relative ease, and seizing the system in the name of the Сім'я Ню.</t>
 <t id="1030519">This is the home to the once great Ryk Family. After a territorial dispute with the Njy family, Ryk lost one of their two outposts. The second colony is this system, which was taken from the ownership of the last Patriarch who fell in a great battle with Сім'я Ронкар. Unlike some other systems in the local area, this system is relatively uninteresting, but one may find the odd skirmish between the neighbouring Boron colony and the Ryk Family. </t>
 <t id="1030601">This crowded system produces high quality food, clothing and computer equipment for the neighbouring systems. A strange religious sect reside here in a huge orbiting temple, searching for the secrets of sentient life in the Universe by studying ancient legends and deep historical analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030602">This mining outpost is surrounded by a field of mineral bearing asteroids with a particularly dense asteroid field to the north. Pirate activity is light and generally non-aggressive, mostly transports headed for the north gate. This is fortunate as high-speed combat in this system is made difficult by the asteroids which also play havoc with missile targeting scanners.</t>
 <t id="1030603">This quiet and unassuming system is a resupply point for the Аргон military. Hostile activity is generally minimal as it is well guarded by security patrols. The space equipment dock is a useful source of surplus military equipment as well as second hand kit used by the many Аргон Military training outposts in the area.</t>
 <t id="1030604">Much of the illicit trading in the known universe goes on in this system. Пірат and smugglers trade with all races and act as go-betweens for sensitive or illegal deals between species. There is a thriving industry in the cheap, counterfeit Паранід jewellery that is often used as conveniently anonymous payment in black market deals.</t>
 <t id="1030605">The last Ксенон conflict with the sentient races brought forth many heroes. This system is named after one of the foremost of those who risked all to repel the Ксенон threat. Although the name still has deep echoes of honour, courage and wisdom, the system is corrupt and dangerous. The Аргон are particularly concerned that the use of this system as a base for the slave trade is an insult to one of their most honoured names.</t>
 <t id="1030606">Although this system is a hive of Agricultural and Industrial activity many respectable traders and merchants avoid it. Adventure seekers and rogues of all species frequent this system, the often Pirate Base is a real den of iniquity and squalor. This system is a major link in the Спліт - Теладі trade route and its safety is jealously protected by the Profit Guild.</t>
 <t id="1030607">On the fringes of civilised space this deep space system is no stranger to raids by Пірат and other hostile ships. Founded by the Спліт leader Thuruk as a prison colony for Boron captured during their wars it has evolved into a thriving industrial outpost.</t>
 <t id="1030611">Situated between two uninhabitable dust planets this relatively new Теладі system produces raw materials as well as light weapons for military and exploration ships. This system is earmarked by the Profit Guild for priority expansion and investment.</t>
 <t id="1030612">This system is home to the organisation that controls the supply of the rare mineral Nividium. Its factories produces high-quality weapons for the Теладі as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by both the PTNI's security arm as well as Теладі Company ships.</t>
 <t id="1030614">This Аргон colony was founded by Kleo Gult, head of the Аргон Agricultural Council, but as work continued, it was discovered that more uses could be found for the system. The sector is owned by the AAC which means very little money has been put aside for updating non-essential technology. Residents have thus needed to find a way to make money apart from selling wares and produce. It is believed that there are some illegal goods being sold in the sector, but this has yet to be proven as residents police and protect this sector themselves. Streams of nebula also inhabit this system, and Коло Праці is usually home to several scientists who try to find a way to mine this untouched resource. The system is unusual as the sun bursts with strong phases of intense light.</t>
 <t id="1030616">This system was once a Спліт mining outpost. One Tazura a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by Аргон Federation security operatives in Чорне Сонце. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a shattered, radioactive hell. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Ксенон super-weapon is to blame and access to the system is now restricted. Pilots who passed though this system once said that there was a large ship in this system, but recently these reports have stopped. If this ship existed, then it is Невідомий where it has gone now.</t>
 <t id="1030617">This deep space system is about as close as the Спліт get to a civilian operation. It produces food and other organic products and mines the asteroids that are spread throughout the system. Although there is little military presence here all Спліт are required to complete combat training and civilian Спліт pilots are no easy target.</t>
 <t id="1030701">The Ore and Silicon mines in this system provide mineral resources to the entire Паранід Empire. These energy hungry mines operate continuously, their workers dedicating their labour to the glory of the Xaar. The Паранід Empire permits limited mining on the untapped asteroids in this sector but only Паранід may enter the sacred mines on the 'rusty planet' XylaXaar.</t>
 <t id="1030702">The jewel of the Паранід Empire produces some of the finest ship equipment available - devastating thermo-nuclear missiles, semi-organic ship hulls, artificially intelligent flight systems and highly powerful lasers are among the tech products to be found. The skies of Паранід Прайм are dominated by a fiery gas cloud, the aftermath of a terrible Ксенон experiment.</t>
 <t id="1030703">Although this system is primarily concerned with agricultural production, the factories in this system make it a prime target for raiding or sabotage. The stormy ringed planet that dominates this system is currently being terraformed by the Паранід for inhabitation in the near future.</t>
 <t id="1030704">This system manufactures hardware for the refit yards in Гряда Імператора. It also provides masses of mineral and organic products to be consumed by their crews. Despite a heavy security around the military installations the Space Jewellery workshop provides rich pickings for the more aggressive and desperate looters and Пірат based in nearby systems.</t>
 <t id="1030705">This lawless system is the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants have made a fortune trading illicit goods, many, many more have been ripped-off, ambushed, swindled, bushwhacked, conned, assaulted, hijacked, stranded, killed or worse.</t>
 <t id="1030706">Bathed in the scorched glow of a burning nebula, this system was levelled by the devastating experimental weaponry used by Ксенон forces in the last great conflict. Once a busy cosmopolitan trading outpost, it is now a rough and ready mining community run by smuggler overlords, possibly in the pay of the powerful Паранід Jewellery cartels.</t>
 <t id="1030707">After the Ксенон conflict this system was abandoned. When the retreating Ксенон completely destroyed a neighbouring system by forcing its twin suns to go nova, the colonies and factories of this system were eradicated. It is the home to many refugees of the last Ксенон war and the other minor wars that came before it. The people here begin to build new lives and homes while they mourn their past and hope for their future.</t>
 <t id="1030708">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Аргон after the last Ксенон war. Пагорб Аладни was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. The jump gate used by the Ксенон to retreat was left intact, allowing rapid exploration of the space beyond this system and the ruthless hunting of Ксенон stragglers by rogue squads of revenge-seeking veterans.</t>
 <t id="1030709">The ageing but brilliant nuclear scientist, Akeela Hartnell, had one dream: to create a string of artificial suns that would light her way, and provide solar power for the ever expanding colonisation of sectors and planets by all races. The vessel that would allow Akeela to see her dream set off on its journey, but as it cleared the Омікрон Ліри system the ship was hit by an asteroid travelling so fast that it was virtually impossible to avoid, greatly damaging the ship. The crew, except for Akeela, disembarked and made their escape from the ship at best speed. Akeela succeeded in getting the ship away from the inhabited sectors, but the resulting explosion changed the sectors gate that locked onto the Пагорб Аладни sector. For a project that nearly ended in disaster, Маяк Акіли is her gift to the people of the galaxy. A request by Akeela's last will and testament asked that the Аргон govern the new system, but it should be a free place, and a safe haven for all traders. The four glowing stars that once graced this sector, - the result of Akeela's dream, are all but faded and gone. Yet her dream remains in the hearts of many, and so the sector is named after her.</t>
 <t id="1030712">Dedicated mostly to the production of Nostrop Oil for use in the industrial installations in the neighbouring systems, Зелена Луска is situated in a small asteroid field near the garden planet 'Nature's Profit', the native home of the Swamp Plant and Sunrise Flower.</t>
 <t id="1030713">Named after the Аргон heroine and Гонер priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Аргон leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. It is now a rough place where times are hard and people harder. There is much illegal activity in this system and skirmishes are common.</t>
 <t id="1030714">Омікрон Ліри remains true to the courage and conviction of those who knew that this sector would not be the last will and testament to the battle fought against the Хаак. Here lie the souls of those not forgotten, those who understood that this would be the point at which all races would stand tall and take the battle onwards. Those remaining here are neither forsaken or left without hope. Life goes on, while in the shadows lurk the destroyers of worlds.</t>
 <t id="1030715">This struggling Аргон agricultural system is situated between the breathtaking planets 'Garleth Prime' and 'Garleth Beta'. Recent attacks on supply lines by Ксенон forces have led to many fire-fights among the installations, asteroids and the busy trade routes in this system.</t>
 <t id="1030716">The furthest Federation outpost from Аргон Prime, this dangerous system is both a deep-space resupply point and military tracking station. Ксенон activity in this system is carefully monitored by a covert Federation branch who are rumoured to have an inaccessible base hidden near the storm-battered planet 'Hades'.</t>
 <t id="1030802">Perhaps the stunning gas nebulae that dominate the view in this system and the general atmosphere of peace and tranquillity are what inspire the gorgeous jewellery crafted by the Паранід here. The tiny masterpieces they craft from Majaglit can take years to complete and are collected avariciously by art enthusiasts from around the systems.</t>
 <t id="1030803">This highly agricultural system provides much of the Soja Beans that form the basis of the Паранід diet. The highly ionised water of the system's planet contains rare organic minerals that greatly improve the flavour of Beans nurtured in it. This system suffered particularly heavy losses in the last Ксенон conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030804">This system contains the main Equipment Dock used to refit medium Паранід Fighters. These weapons are of the highest quality and Паранід technology is extremely reliable. This system was hit heavily in the last Ксенон conflict and security is still tight. This system represents the far border of the 'Old Паранід Empire', the 'New Empire' consisting of territories claimed since the conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030808">This system serves as the source of ships and equipment for the Аргон settlement of areas of space recently claimed after the Ксенон conflict. The majority of traffic here is comprised of Аргон scout ships and transports headed from newly founded colonies and the fringe systems.</t>
 <t id="1030811">This busy Теладі colony was named in honour of the warriors and civilians of all species who perished in the first great Ксенон conflict. The system itself is sparse and lacks many basic comforts. The Теладі here are possibly even more avaricious and sneaky than their homeworld brothers.</t>
 <t id="1030812">There is no data on this sector save that it contains a huge watery planet known by the Boron as 'Saa-Russ' or 'Life of the Sea' which legend insists is inhabited by giant sea dragons. Many ships have set out to explore this system, very few have returned.</t>
 <t id="1030816">This strange system is named for a Гонер belief that Nathan R Gunne once visited this system, the reason for this belief is that when first entered, a piece of debris was found, after an investigation it was found to be from two ancient fleets. All the debris has been cleared up and a new system has been forged in the brown nitrogen dioxide nebula streams of the system. Pirate activity is also increased and has meant increased military patrols in this system. Many pilots tend to avoid the gas clouds, as pirate ships have been known to hide in the nebulas and then participate in surprise attacks. The local population are made of mixed labour level, from high tech support to miners. </t>
 <t id="1030817">The original name for this sector was Light Of Hope, until the Ксенон attacked many jazuras ago. It was clear that the sectors patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using small transport ships. Backup from the Аргон Military was sent; four Titan class destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with fighter wings. They were to escort the transport ships out of the system, but before they could get to the gate, Ксенон ships jumped in and overwhelmed the destroyers and carriers. All civilian ships and one destroyer, the Challenger, escaped. Three jazuras later, an Аргон force, with Boron assistance, took back Light Of Hope and it was renamed Wastelands, reflecting the carnage and debris that the force found.  Now cleared of that detritus and with the Ксенон threat now greatly diminished, its inhabitants strive to maintain a normal existence.</t>

 <t id="1030902">The name is deceiving, but there is a meaning. The sector is located close to the Ma'kare star, the dominating feature is the flare that streams though the system. Because the stations are located so close to the star, all stations were fitted with a new reflective Teladianium armour that allow for the flares to hit the station and only affect it slightly, although the shields do protect the stations by absorbing 80 percent of the energy, the rest is reflected back by the armour. The name comes from the high priest, who visited this sector shortly after discovery, back then the flare was still at a distance, and the moving star was also at a distance, so the sector was a void, any religious Паранід thought that the star that was drawing closer was an omen, and so many preachers came to see this, hence the name.</t>
 <t id="1030904">Despite fanciful miners' tales that the asteroids in this system are all made of solid Nividium they seem to be rich in only the more mundane ore and silicon. The two factories producing cheap, commercial jewellery for the export market are well defended against opportunistic attack but attract the occasional raids from determined freeloaders.</t>
 <t id="1030906">With the discovery of the North Gate in the neighbouring 'Shore Of Infinity' sector, Light Water was founded. With a mixture of food production and solar power generators, this system has grown in importance. The name Light Water was given to this sector as the only habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size, its surface being mostly covered in water. The Boron have recently founded a planet-based colony using materials that were destined for the LooManckStrat's Legacy system before plans were scrapped.</t>
 <t id="1030908">This mining outpost is still being founded near the red gas giant 'Hitt's Eye'. The trading, food and materials installations are in place and waiting to service the eagerly awaited private mining outfits who are always looking for new sources of minerals.</t>
 <t id="1030910">The Теладі claimed this system with the sole intention of colonising the two massive planets here. The awful fate of the first scouting parties to the planets' surfaces and the discovery of the hostile nature of the indigenous life forms dwelling there have ended such plans and the system is slowly decaying into a place of fear, lawlessness and anarchy.</t>
 <t id="1030911">The Теладі have only recently re-discovered this historically important system. Ianamus Zura already has its own thriving economy, mainly due to its position on a busy trade route. It provides a broad range of raw materials to many neighbouring systems and serves as the HQ of both the Profit Guild and Теладі Company in the new territories.</t>
 <t id="1030917">Interworlds is so called because of its strange arrangement of planets, two planets inhabit the system and create a bottleneck with the jump gate route. The entire system was only accessible via one lone gate when first discovered. Originally an agricultural colony built by the Аргон to supply food supplies to rest of the Аргон Federation, Interworlds has expanded to include more high tech stations and products. It is also home to the 4th Аргон Expeditionary Force, which is still looking for any new gate routes that can be used. </t>
 <t id="1031002">The last great Duke came to this sector and after a few short stazuras being in the system he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Паранід and a strange alien race, now known to be the Хаак. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Паранід Прайм in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow. </t>
 <t id="1031003">This sector is considered to be one of high importance. In ancient times the Emperor's palace in the high mountains of the Паранід Homeworld became so cold the ice would keep away any travellers. The Emperor chose on such occasions to stay at his winter palace in the equatorial region. When the Ксенон nearly destroyed Паранід Прайм's atmosphere, the equatorial region was all but lost. Until recently the Emperor stayed at his palace in the mountains, accessible because of the heat from the Ксенон experiment. In order to keep with tradition he set up a new winter palace in this sector, overlooking a great lake at the foot on the Kar Miat Mountains. In the winter of Паранід Прайм's northern hemisphere, the Emperor usually occupies this sector with his advisory Dukes, keeping the long tradition that was lost for so long.</t>
 <t id="1031004">This system's heavy security is due to its principal export - Jewellery and Maja Snails. The wild and untamed twin planets here are home to a nomadic workforce, famous for their expertise in raising the delicate snails. These shy, reclusive Паранід tend Snail Farms across all known space. The most valuable installations in this system are protected on two sides by artificially constructed asteroid belts.</t>
 <t id="1031005">Despite being the furthest Паранід system from Паранід Прайм the Xaarist Priests run Preacher's Refuge with strict religious fervour and propriety. Their quiet and devoted worker-monks produce exquisite jewellery, inspirational 'Xja' poetry and the very best in automated, semi-intelligent weapons.</t>
 <t id="1031006">Of little use to the Паранід, this system is leased by the Boron who have a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants here. Limited trade between the Паранід and Boron takes place here and relations between the species are amicable. In return for Паранід protection the Boron lend their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Паранід efforts in cyberbiology.</t>
 <t id="1031007">This asteroid scattered system provides much of the organic supplies required by the 'New Boron Colonies'. Many of the ships used in building and servicing the surrounding Boron systems are built here.</t>
 <t id="1031008">This new Boron colony is being constructed with the aid of the Аргон. After heavy losses in the Спліт and Ксенон conflicts the Boron are eager not to confine themselves to one cluster of systems as they have in the past. The foundations of a thriving mining colony have already been completed and stage two is well underway.</t>
 <t id="1031009">This busy Boron mining colony doubles as a refit and supply centre for Boron ships working the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids make the Boron who dwell here harder and more cynical than their compatriots nearer the Boron home systems.</t>
 <t id="1031010">This system is typical of small scale Теладі trading outposts. It produces Теладі speciality goods as well as traditional foodstuffs both for local and export markets. The Теладі merchants here trade mainly with the Boron living in neighbouring space but naturally they welcome any visitor with credit to spare.</t>
 <t id="1031104">Being the first and only Теладі Sector located next to a Паранід Sector, the Теладі opened this sector for massive amounts of trade, but trade with the Паранід was not a sensible decision. Trade was low, and not many Паранід passed these sectors, the odd ship coming in for supplies. The Теладі Chairman for this sector noticed they were slowly going into debt and so pulled out most of the high tech factories. The sector from this point on was dubbed bad debt, and the name stuck since that time. Although relations between the two races are improving, trade is increasing at a minimal rate. Because of this debt the Теладі trade dock is relatively quiet, with cargo bays remaining empty and most market sections closed off and in a state of decay.</t>
 <t id="1031110">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through this system. Subsequently many jazuras of archaeology and recovery was undertaken with the assistance of the Аргон. After the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in, but the jump into the system did not go as planned. On entry, they found themselves in the middle of a pirate ambush. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed. The Пірат have since planted a large minefield in the hope of capturing other ships; travel through this system should be taken with great care.</t>
 <t id="1031202">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031203">This sector contains one half of Family Rhy's assets. They use this system as a supply depot to passing Спліт craft. The planet's main colony consists of a large geodesic dome. Inside one can find large amounts of weaponry being sold in armoury markets. Pirate activity in this system is also increased because of the local activity, but the Rhy Family does nothing to stop this. Being on the border of the local Теладі Sectors, Rhy's Desire can usually find large numbers of Теладі coming in to trade and purchase these illegal goods.</t>
 <t id="1031204">The pride of the local Теладі sectors is this colony; the high tower of the Ministry Of Finance stands high on the planets surface. The Ministry was set up to oversee the Company's finances when setting up new sectors, although this wing of the Теладі Company wasn't entirely successful. When the neighbouring system, Bad Debt, was first opened to the public, the sector ran into trouble and the Ministry was held responsible. The colony skyline is dominated by the 80 story tower that casts a shadow over the gardens of trade, a large garden filled with markets and made more appealing to visiting Аргон and Boron traders. </t>
 <t id="1031210">This sector was worthless to other races, inaccessible by other races because of the minefield in the sector to the north. This sector was originally a boron research sector, and with a handful of stations this colony was a working one. When the colony plans for LooManckStrat's Legacy fell though after a pirate attack this colony had to be abandoned. Some stations were scuttled others were later reactivated by pirate forces who have now laid claim to this system.</t>

 <t id="1031303">The lesser family of Rhy, in the days before space colonisation, spent most of their time on Спліт Prime, using their knowledge of espionage and sabotage to plunder other families resources and claim them as salvage. Rhy moved off-world to their own system when they became a more powerful family, after helping the Сім'я Ронкар in their battle against the old Patriarch. This sector contains half of the family's assets in space trading, including their own carrier. Rhy no longer uses espionage as their main trait, but are now starting to build up their own military. There are also rumours in local bars of a hidden gate in or near to this system.</t>
 <t id="1031310">This rogue sector is on the main trade lane between old sectors and more recent expansions of the Паранід Empire. A small trading post that runs itself independently from other races. It has little or no police, with pirate raiding parties taking the opportunity to seize power in this system. Most ships that come though this sector can be expected to come under some form of attack, and with the Паранід not willing to send in forces to assist ships with the exception of other Паранід traders, there is little chance of official help.</t>
 <t id="1031316">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031401">The RBMD or Royal Boron Military Defence, system 'Depths Of Silence', was formed to build new ships and develop new technologies. This system is heavily guarded in case of attack by Ксенон or other forces hostile to the Boron Navy. The sector is filled with high-tech Boron Stations, including those that specialise in the production of new Boron weapons systems. Entrance to this system is granted if you're carrying cargo to this system, or if you have previous access rights.</t>
 <t id="1031402">This system is rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. If you enter this system there is a great possibility that the local military police force will scan your ship; if you have hostile intentions you will be attacked. It is this tightened security that has led to these rumours. The sector itself is a small trade outpost with little need for high tech goods.</t>
 <t id="1031403">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system is a source of strategic power for the Boron. Being a border colony to the local Спліт Family, this sector also acts as a crossroads for other Boron settlements, making it particularly important for passing trade. It is guarded by a lone destroyer with escorts, pirate activity here is minimal.</t>
 <t id="1031404">This system was originally empty with a few asteroids creating a barrier near the gate, this was until the Boron moved the gate away from the vein of asteroids. Barren Shores today has become a thriving trade colony with exports being high. Whether high-tech goods are available at this time is Невідомий.</t>
 <t id="1031409">This sector was formed shortly after the claiming of the sector to the south. Set up originally as a monastery, it provided a place for the passing priests to pray and hold quiet meditation. Military forces were virtually non-existent during early settlement, leaving the monastery open to attack by raiding parties from the nearby Pirate sectors. The Priests held their position in the safety of the temple caverns for several Tazuras before the Паранід managed to get a destroyer in the sector to protect it. The destroyer has now moved to the next sector to prevent such insertions into Паранід territory.</t>
 <t id="1031410">With most of the Паранід now in space-borne colonies, the high priest of the Паранід chose to seek a new Cardinal to set up his religious sections in the new Duchy Systems. This sector is now home to the Cardinal who chose this sector for the capital of the Second Duchy. The system boasts shipyard facilities, and equipment docks, as well as being guarded by a Destroyer ship, mainly for protection from the Пірат from past the north gate.</t>
 <t id="1031411">When the Паранід first entered this system they found an empty sector accessible by two gates, but the planet remains a mystery here. There are a few remnants of a civilization with one relic, - a needle-like object made from stone that stands 3 stories high, in the middle of what may have been a city. At the foot of the monument a large gemstone was found inside a carved stone case. After prolonged surveys it was discovered that there was once a large building here, which was thought to be a temple. Scientists today are still trying to understand what the script on the needle object means.</t>

 <t id="1031503">This sector holds a major settlement recently set up by the Boron, a construction colony based on ship production. The system is named for the nebula that is located nearby. The colony itself has facilities for both families and the military, with municipal recreation domes containing restaurants, water-parks and marinas.</t>
 <t id="1031509">Spring of Belief was originally a Boron sector named &quot;Queen's Paradise&quot;. An accident during a scientific experiment on the planets surface released vast amounts of radiation. Soon after, the local population started to die of a mysterious disease. When it was discovered that the radiation was the cause, the Boron Government ordered an evacuation of the sector. Ксенон fleets also tried to inhabit the sector, but the radiation affected electronic systems onboard their craft. As the radiation grew weaker the Паранід finally settled in this system and claimed it as their own. With the radiation now a minor problem the Boron Government has tried to reclaim the system, but the Паранід Government refuses to give up their tenure.</t>
 <t id="1031510">This sector is occupied by one planet and the remains of its only moon. It is Невідомий how the moon was destroyed in this manner, but the fallout has caused the planet's atmosphere to become irradiated, leaving it deadly to all forms of life. When the Паранід moved in, they set up a standard colony with basic resources. Hopefully in time more will be built.</t>

 <t id="0">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Food Rations</t>
 <t id="1">[title]Refugee Crisis Imminent! $TRADERANK$ Pilots required![/title]\n\n[justify]A message for all pilots with a clean, good condition $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Time is short, so this communication will be brief. It seems there has been a period of conflict near to $THERESECTOR$ which has caused many races to flee to safer sectors. Most of them are now being held in the $THERE$ but there is a problem. This station is not equipped to handle so many at one time. Whilst they have sufficient Medical Equipment, they are running very low on Food Rations. We really need to get some there soon. The authorities fear that if they do not receive any within $TIMELIMIT$ then the refugees may attempt to storm the station and seize it by force. Therefore a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft is needed to deliver $AMOUNT$ units of Food Rations there within $TIMELIMIT$.\n\nOnce hired, the pilot will be paid $REWARD$ for his troubles and if he gets there fast enough he may get up to $BONUSREWARD$ as well. We are confident there are many pilots here who look up to such a benevolent mission.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="2">Keep going pilot - you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining to deliver the goods</t>
 <t id="3">That's fantastic! You've made it well ahead of schedule. I'm more than impressed with your skills pilot.\n\nHere is your reward. I was going to pay you just $REWARD$ but instead I'm going to give you an additional $BONUSREWARD$ as well on account of the time you've saved and the skills you've shown. Well done! We'll be in touch again I'm sure.</t>
 <t id="4">Pilot, this is $AUTHOR$ from the $HERE$, you procured some $WARES$ from us recently as you may recall. Well, even though you were a good pilot in our books, it looks like you don't have the necessary standing to deliver the $WARES$ to the station. Something appears to have happened that has caused them to deny you docking rights. We're not sure what but it doesn't seem good. I'm afraid we're going to have to take your name off the list of pilots we can trust. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Sorry but the contract has been cancelled.</t>
 <t id="5">Excellent. You qualify for this trading run. Remember that you have $TIMELIMIT$ to get to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. The amount placed aboard your ship is $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. Well don't just stand there, get going!!</t>
 <t id="6">Get lost, can't you read or is your translator broken? You need to be at least $TRADERANK$ or higher to cope with this mission</t>
 <t id="7">You have docked at the $THERE$. You have my gratitude for completing the journey. Here is your payment, $REWARD$ as agreed. </t>
 <t id="8">You have arrived at the $THERE$, late. This is quite unacceptable. Your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. Your skills as a pilot leave much to be desired. </t>
 <t id="9">Pilot, You either have a severe memory problem, or you just don't have a clue how to get there. Time has run out and you aren't even close to the $THERE$. As for the payment of $REWARD$ that I was due to pay you, well that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.</t>
 <t id="10">When did you last check your ship? It's not a $SHIPTYPE$ craft. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="11">I'm sorry, it appears that you do not have the necessary storage space needed for this mission. You need a ship that can maintain at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. You're either incredibly bad at basic Гонер arithmetic, or plain stupid. Your authorisation will be reviewed when you have increased your storage capacity. Until then, either dump some cargo or get a bigger ship.</t>
 <t id="12">I'm sorry but you appear to have had some problems with the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ that prevents you from docking there. We don't know what's been happening in your past, but we don't want to be a part of it. We'll find someone else who can get the wares to where we want them to be shipped. </t>
 <t id="13">Pilot, it appears that you have betrayed our agreement. We specifically requested that you deliver the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Unfortunately you do not seem to have taken this instruction onboard. We have received word from the $THERE$ that they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. The hangar crew have confirmed you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items. Payment for this shipment has been cancelled and your ship id has been passed onto all relevant authorities. Do not think you are going to get away with this, the consequences of your actions will soon begin to make themselves clear. Communication Closed!</t>

 <t id="101">[title]Urgent delivery of Weapon Interface Chips required[/title]\n\n[justify]All pilots of $TRADERANK$ or higher are requested to assist in the shipment of a batch of Weapon Interface Chips that are behind schedule. All cargo ships on this station have currently been impounded following investigations by authorities over a possible payment error to a recent trader. For this reason, we require $AMOUNT$ units of WIC's to be shipped to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ immediately. \n\nAny pilots who are at least a rank of $TRADERANK$ with their own $SHIPTYPE$ craft are requested to ship the cargo to $THERE$ within $TIMELIMIT$. Payment of $REWARD$ will be made on completion of the mission, and up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for swift couriers who make it there sooner. If successful, future work will no doubt be offered in due course.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining and counting. $THERE$ are counting on you, make best speed Pilot!</t>
 <t id="103">You have reached the $THERE$ in good time. Your timekeeping is quite impressive. The payment of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account, but you will also find an extra $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the $REWARD$ originally promised. Job well done!</t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THERESECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the $THERE$ to complete your shipment of the $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been cancelled. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about where you fire your lasers. </t>
 <t id="105">Your information checks out and you have been accepted for hauling this cargo. Note that you only have $TIMELIMIT$ to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$.</t>
 <t id="106">You're ranking is lower than $TRADERANK$ - I wouldn't trust you with delivering the mail, let alone our $WARES$. Go away!</t>
 <t id="107">Excellent. You have reached the $THERE$ on time. Payment of the $REWARD$ as agreed has been made directly to your account. Your mission has been completed. You are free to undertake further contracts or continue about your travels. </t>
 <t id="108">Something tells me that you haven't cleaned the spaceflies out from your engines in a long while. Your experience as a pilot leaves much to be desired, I've seen Argnu with better navigation skills. Your payment has been reviewed and consequently reduced. You will find the sum of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="109">I could have sworn I asked you to get to the $THERE$. What part of that order did you not understand pilot?! There's no point in paying you a single credit, you just don't deserve it seeing as your ship is no where near the destination. The $REWARD$ originally destined for your account will be used to find a pilot who actually knows what he's doing.</t>
 <t id="110">If only I had 10 credits for every time a pilot like you wasted my time. You need a $SHIPTYPE$ craft to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="111">There does not appear to be enough cargo capacity in your ship to hold all of the $WARES$. You need at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units in order to take on this mission. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. Unless you do something to balance the two figures out, you can't undertake this mission! Go sell some cargo or get a larger bay, just don't come back until you've learned how to add and subtract!</t>
 <t id="112">We're not going to be able to use you as a pilot I'm afraid. It looks like the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ doesn't like you as much as you might have thought. We're not sure why, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for a pilot who is worthy of their docking rights. </t>
 <t id="113">I can't believe it! Wasn't the payment of $REWARD$ enough for you? Apparently you took it upon yourself to make some of the $WARES$ we had asked you to ship part of your reward too. This is unacceptable. If the $THERE$ are to be believed, and I have more reason to believe them than I do you, they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ from your ships cargo bay. Back here the cargo inventory systems have confirmed that you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items! We've been doing business with companies in $THERESECTOR$ for longer than you've been flying, this is the first time we've had a Pilot go rogue on us. So, it looks like we're going to have to revoke your payment of $REWARD$ and place you on the list of Pilots who can't keep their word, let alone their cargo!</t>
 <t id="200">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="201">[title]Latest Entertainment Chips ready for Release![/title]\n\n[justify]The latest version of the popular Entertainment Chips are now in full production. Representatives for the distributors are awaiting test stock at $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. There are $AMOUNT$ units to deliver. You will need a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft and rank of at least $TRADERANK$ to do so.\n\nIf you can get them there within $TIMELIMIT$ we will reward you with a payment of $REWARD$. If you can get them there earlier, we can surprise the market with an early release and you could get up to $BONUSREWARD$ extra. Applicants must be aware that disclosure of any information regarding this hardware is strictly prohibited prior to the release.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="202">I've seen faster spaceflies, but unlike them, you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining</t>
 <t id="203">You have reached the $THERE$. Thank you for getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ so quickly. Here is your payment of $REWARD$. We are more than happy to offer you the bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the original payment. You travel light, travel fast, and you do it well. Should some express freight transport be needed in future, you will be on our lists.</t>
 <t id="204">Hey! I don't think you're going to be able to dock at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ anymore to deliver your $WARES$. What in Splits Fire are you doing out there!? The $THERE$ has notified us that they have marked you down for neutralization should you return anywhere near their station. Whatever it is you've done, it looks like we're not going to be able to pay you the $REWARD$  we had reserved for completion of your shipment. Sorry but you're no longer on our list of pilots we'd like to have work for us. Find your haulage contracts elsewhere from now on. </t>
 <t id="205">Ok great, looks like a fast ship to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. $TIMELIMIT$ is a little bit restrictive so you better get a move on.</t>
 <t id="206">Sorry pilot - you need to be $TRADERANK$ or higher to help us with this mission. Come back when you have more experience</t>
 <t id="207">You have arrived at the $THERE$ in good time. I'm happy to pay you the $REWARD$ as per our agreement. Your skills as a pilot are worthy of note. Perhaps you should enlist as a transport pilot full time?</t>
 <t id="208">You have finally docked at the $THERE$. Due to the extreme amount of time taken to reach the station, your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. This sum has already been transferred to your account. It is suggested that you use this money to purchase some sector maps and perhaps a few extra engine tunings. It looks like you need them. </t>
 <t id="209">You are quite incredible, you seem to know how to dock at every single station apart from the $THERE$ where you were actually asked you to go! Your payment of $REWARD$ is staying in my account, you won't be getting any of it!</t>
 <t id="210">I said only $SHIPTYPE$ class craft would be good enough for this mission, can't you read?</t>
 <t id="211">Your ship is not equipped with the necessary cargo space in order to complete this mission. The shipment requires a minimum of $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. It appears that you have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$. I do not think I need to continue any further. Please obtain the correct level of storage space before attempting to gain authorization for this mission. </t>
 <t id="212">We'd like to be able to take you on as our pilot, but it seems the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ have other plans in mind. They consider you a threat to their station. Thanks for the interest though. We'll be sure to be in touch when your reputation has improved. </t>
 <t id="213">Attention, we have just received word from the $THERE$ that you have not delivered all of the $WARES$ that we loaded onto your ship. Is there a problem Pilot? We specifically agreed on a payment of $REWARD$ for the shipment of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$. It seems that from this original agreement, you have taken it upon yourself to only ship $PLAYERSAMOUNT$, so where are the rest of the units? This is not something we consider to be either funny or conducive to a good business partnership. Your ship id has been registered with the authorities. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Do not think this will do your standing in the local sectors any good at all Pilot. </t>
 <t id="300">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="301">[title]Nebulae Gas Causes Damage To Station!! Help!!![/title]\n\n[justify]News of an incident at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ involving a long-distance freighter has just been received. A discharge of nebulae gas into station electronics by the vessel has meant that many of the cartography systems have sustained irreparable damage. Cartography Chips are now urgently required in order that correct navigation and course mapping be continued. Pilots who have control of $SHIPTYPE$ class craft are asked to assist in the shipment of the Cartographic Hardware. Your trade rank must be at least $TRADERANK$. The greater experience you have however, the more successful you will be. With no spare Cartography Chips available, it has been confirmed that $AMOUNT$ chips from this station $HERE$ are to be couriered to $THERE$ in order that all systems remain operational.\n\nAs advised, pilots will require a $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Shipment of the cargo within $TIMELIMIT$ is your priority task. You will receive payment of $REWARD$ on completion and installation of the goods. Couriers able to reach the destination earlier will receive up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for their skill and precision. Please contact Station authorities on acceptance of this mission. Goods will be loaded onto your ship immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="302">Keep it steady pilot, don't forget the $REWARD$ waiting for you if you complete the delivery within the next $TIMELEFT$</t>
 <t id="303">You've managed to make good time, thanks for making the effort in getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ on time. The bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ is yours!! And of course the initial $REWARD$. Thanks for the help.</t>
 <t id="304">Pilot, mission is aborted! We've just received comms from the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. It appears that they have revoked all docking privileges for your ship as well as your id. They have asked us to notify you that you can take the $WARES$ you were due to ship to them and shove them up your plasma ducts. We're not too sure what it is you've been doing out there, but the payment of $REWARD$ is no longer available to you. The contract has been cancelled. Find someone else to play your games with. </t>
 <t id="305">Hmm well everything appears to check out. The $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ are on board. $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ are expecting you in $TIMELIMIT$ or less. Good Journey Pilot!!</t>
 <t id="306">You must be $TRADERANK$ or higher to help us here. Go get some practice under your belt and then come back</t>
 <t id="307">Ah, you're there! You may not be the best pilot around, but you're certainly the most reliable. As agreed, here's the payment of $REWARD$. Go buy yourself a drink!</t>
 <t id="308">You are quite possibly one of the worst pilots I have ever had the misfortune to come across. What took you so long? The original payment I had intended to make to you has been cancelled, but since you made it to the $THERE$, I will still pay you a token sum of $REWARD$ . Now go get your engines serviced!</t>
 <t id="309">Okay, I've had just about enough of this! You are possibly one of the worst transport pilots I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Where did you learn to fly? With the Спліт!? Do you even know where the $THERE$ is!? Your reward of $REWARD$ isn't going anywhere near your account pilot! </t>
 <t id="310">Sorry pilot, I can't accept as you need a $SHIPTYPE$ craft to help us here. Try again once you have a new ship as we always need some help</t>
 <t id="312">It seems that the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ don't seem to like you or trust you as much as we do. We're going to have to deny your request to transport the $WARES$, - you just wouldn't be able to get the freight anywhere near the $THERE$, let alone dock. Thanks for your interest though, we'll be in touch when your reputation isn't so hot. </t>
 <t id="313">This is incredible! What do you think you are playing at Pilot? Did you think you could fool us that easily? We have just received a cargo manifest report from the $THERE$, they are far from happy.

However, we simply do not have atmospheric conditioners here that have the efficiency to keep them stable, they are already starting to break up. We need someone with a $SHIPTYPE$ ship to urgently courier these Artefacts over to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. They will be able to stabilize the Artefacts there. We will pay $REWARD$ for successful delivery, and if delivered within $TIMELIMIT$ then we may raise your payment with an extra $BONUSREWARD$. It should be evident that these Artefacts are extremely important to us and we believe they could tell us something about our history.\n\nOnly pilots who are confident of success should accept this mission - we wouldn't want to let these Artefacts be destroyed so soon after receiving them.

 <t id="40101">[title]Combat Transport Required[/title]\n\n[justify]Attention! BBS entry has been classified. A military transport vessel has been redirected to another sector due to unforeseen hostilities. $AMOUNT$ combat veterans need urgent transport from this $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Group Commanders will not accept any level of pilot, or ship. Pilots must have a $SHIPTYPE$ class vessel, along with adequate combat and piloting experience. The deadline for reaching the $THERE$ is $TIMELIMIT$, you have to be at least $TRADERANK$ as well as being of trusted origin, fail to make that deadline and your payment of $REWARD$ will either be revoked or severely reduced. If however pilots have craft able to reach the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ quite a bit earlier, the Group Commander will ensure payment of additional funds unto a maximum of $BONUSREWARD$ . Those who consider themselves worthy, report to the hangar bay immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="40102">You are on a schedule here. You have $TIMELEFT$ left before your reward will be either reduced or revoked. Get to $THERE$ in time. </t>
 <t id="40103">Well you got them there pretty damn fast, I am amazed. Here's the $REWARD$ and the additional $BONUSREWARD$ that I promised if you were quick, and boy were you quick.</t>
 <t id="40104">Something you did recently has the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ really angry, I've been talking to them, and they aren't going to let you onto their station. Please drop off the $WARES$ to a station that you can dock with, so I can get them picked up.</t>
 <t id="40105">Far out Pilot, how do you keep your ship in such a mess? The $WARES$ need to be $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ soon, so they have no choice but take the trip with you. Remember $TIMELIMIT$ ok?</t>
 <t id="40107">You were cutting it close, I hope that none of the $WARES$ were getting too restless. Here's the agreed $REWARD$.</t>
 <t id="40108">There you are...finally. I was getting worried sick for the $WARES$. You are late, at least you arrived I suppose. I'm reducing the payment to $REWARD$, be thankful you got that much.</t>
 <t id="40109">Have you been flying in circles? I could have walked to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ by now, drop the $WARES$ off at the next station. I am very disappointed with your service. If you want payment you will be in for a long wait! Now get them to a station, now!</t>
 <t id="40111">I'm just wondering, where would I put them if I gave this job to you? You have no space Pilot. </t>
 <t id="40113">Pilot? What just happened? Has there been a hull breach? We appear to have lost some of the life signs from your passengers. This is unacceptable. The incident will be reported to the authorities immediately. Do not think this little incident will not go against your record. Next time you travel by TP as a passenger yourself, I suggest you wear a spacesuit, you may need it. </t>
 <t id="40114">Thank God, I was worried the $WARES$ were never going to get off of your damn ship. Good bye and good riddance.</t>
 <t id="40203">Ok how did you do that? $TIMELEFT$ and you are here already! Alright here's the extra $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the $REWARD$, you have earned it.</t>
 <t id="40204">What's going on Pilot? I've got reports that you are doing bad things for your reputation with $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. They will no longer allow you to dock with their station!. Well all you can do is drop the $WARES$ to another station, that way I can get someone to pick them up. I hope not all pilots are like you.</t>
 <t id="40205">Awesome, now move it if you want to be in $THERESECTOR$ in $TIMELIMIT$. $THERE$ are waiting for the $WARES$, so please hurry.</t>
 <t id="40207">Seems that the $WARES$ were in for quite a ride, they are saying that you had refreshments for them for the trip, good job Pilot, here's the $REWARD$ we agreed on.</t>
 <t id="40208">I've heard the $WARES$ are quite stressed, and no wonder. They must have been wondering if you were ever going to drop them off at $THERE$ at all. $REWARD$ is all you are getting, now get in your ship and go somewhere else.</t>
 <t id="40209">Excuse me, shouldn't you have got the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ by now? I would like them to be dropped off at the next Station, so I can organize faster onward travel. As you have not completed your part of the bargain I will retain the fee.</t>
 <t id="40211">Seems your ship is pretty much full, I'm sorry but people actually need space to move around. I will wait for someone else to accept this offer</t>

 <t id="40309">That's incredible, are you sure your engines are actually working? That throttle control does actually move forward if you hadn't guessed! The time to get the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ has expired. We need to find a pilot who is capable of making good time and completing the mission. Please drop off the $WARES$ at the nearest station for pickup by courier. </t>
 <t id="40314">Thank you for docking. $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. You are free to continue your journey. </t>
 <t id="40409">It appears that you have as much skill in navigating the sectors as a drunken Гонер. The time allowed to deliver the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ has ended. We need to retrieve them from your ship in order to pass them on to a more competent pilot. Please drop the $WARES$ off at the next station you dock with!</t>
 <t id="40414">$AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. Thank you for docking. You may proceed to Hangar Bay IV for maintenance or depart at your discretion.</t>
 <t id="40509">I'm afraid the time given to deliver the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ is over. You are by far the worst pilot we have had the misfortune of employing. Why didn't you tell us you didn't know how to fly!? Please drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station in order for us to pass them over to a more competent pilot. </t>

 <t id="60001">[title]Pirate Shipments Required[/title]\n\n[justify]Pilots who are willing to refrain from asking questions are required urgently.

Anything less and requests for authorization will be dropped like an empty spacefuel canister. Also a ship of $SHIPTYPE$ class is required and the deadline for the destination is $TIMELIMIT$. Pilots who can make it there in time will be paid $REWARD$, those able to make it there sooner may deserve more, if so an additional $BONUSREWARD$ will be added on top. That is all. Those able to take up this offer, get moving to the hangar bay.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="60002">Get to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ at top speed. No sightseeing! You have $TIMELIMIT$ left, don't waste it.</t>
 <t id="60004">If you think you're going to dock at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$, you've got another thing coming. They don't like you as much as you might have thought, in fact it looks like they don't like you at all. Whatever you've been doing has been enough for them to revoke all docking and trade privileges. Drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station, we may be able to get some close to your position to pick them up. You're on your own now, forget any payment you were hoping to receive. You're not worthy of the $REWARD$ we offered. Mission aborted. </t>
 <t id="60005">You have been confirmed as authorized to enter into this mission. Your records confirm you have no established links with law enforcement units in the local sectors. Information relating to the requirements of the mission will be uploaded into your ships log shortly should you wish to refer to it in the future. Transport $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ from $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ as fast as possible. The deadline for reaching the destination is $TIMELIMIT$. Pilots who can make it there in time will be paid $REWARD$, those able to make it there a lot faster than the $TIMELIMIT$ may get the additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="60008">You fly like a Гонер Priest. When I accepted you as the transport pilot for the $WARES$, I was either under the influence of spacefuel, or just under the impression that you actually knew how to fly. Still, you made it to the $THERE$, how I do not know, so I'm going to pay you $REWARD$ for your trouble. If you think I'm going to give you this kind of mission again, you're going to be waiting a long long time. Go back flight school pilot, you have a long way to go before you can call yourself competent!</t>
 <t id="60100">Q193_PIRATE_PASSENGER_MISSION - Very Important Passenger</t>
 <t id="60101">[title]Clan Leader Needs Transport![/title]\n\n[justify]A pilot with good standing amongst the Pirate leadership is required, someone who also has the ability to keep his mouth shut and his ears closed. No reason or explanation will be given for posting this contract at this time. All that is required is a fast ship of $SHIPTYPE$ class and a pilot who knows how to get both the passenger and any bodyguards, females etc from $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Pilot rank must be a minimum of $TRADERANK$, anything less will not be accepted. Failure to complete this mission on deadline will be taken very seriously. There is a maximum of $TIMELIMIT$ to make it to the $THERE$. The total amount of people including the clan leader will be $AMOUNT$ so make sure no one is left behind. Get there in time and payment of $REWARD$ will be made. Make it there sooner, and an additional sum of $BONUSREWARD$ will enter your account. Success will also ensure Pilots will be marked down for future work. That is all. After a security check, please meet in the hangar bay immediately.[/justify]</t>

I am Commander $AUTHOR$. We are in the process of locating an individual who has been working under our authority as an intermediary between ourselves and various Pirate clans in an effort to cease hostilities. Unfortunately this individual, of $VRACEN$ origin, whom we have confirmed to hold an alias of $VICTIM$, has recently taken it upon himself to return to his home sector of $VSECFN$ along with several thousand terabytes of classified data we currently hold of Pirate clandestine operations. The disclosure of this material to the Pirate home sectors would no doubt cause an immediate rise in hostilities, something we cannot afford at this time due to our myriad enemies making inroads into all sectors that we consider to be of strategic importance.\n\nWe have been able to track $VICTIM$ for the past mizura; he was last seen flying out of a station in $VSECST$. We are expecting him to reach $VSECFN$ as an end-point in his journey at which time he will transfer the data by courier to another source we have not yet been able to identify. This must be avoided at all costs. We have been authorised to offer you $REWARD$ credits in order to terminate this individual. Please confirm your acceptance or rejection of this offer. Should you decline, you will be ordered to undertake a retinal scan and placed under surveillance in order that any information given to you here is not leaked.[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='start']Contact $AUTHOR$[/select][/center][/text]</t>

A $VRACEN$ Cartel has notified me that they hold my dearest partner $AUTHOR$ hostage far from here. Their leader, $VICTIM$, has threatened to kill her if I notify Police forces, or do not surrender a sum of 25,000,000 credits to them. All I have is this one factory, I barely make enough to keep our transports active, I fear that when they hear I neither have the money or ability to pay, they will dispose of her without thought.

If you can neutralise him, I will be able to make contact with her and use this station's defence force to deal with any threat on the station. I will pay you what little money I have, the sum of $REWARD$ credits if you can get me to $VSECFN$ in time to save my partner.

 <t id="306">What? Idiots! Some fool of a station Controller has reallocated our Transporter to another customer and to cap it all a replacement is not available. Sorry we will have to wait till another ship is prepared.</t>
 <t id="307">You don't look very trustworthy to me, I think there are pilots out there better qualified than you.</t>
 <t id="308">I must admit that you don't look stupid, but then looks can be deceiving. How can you protect our Treasures with no weapons? Go away and stop wasting my time!</t>
 <t id="309">That's great, I've paid the $Credits$, but I suggest you get as far as way as possible, this station may not be here much longer!</t>
 <t id="310">Excellent, our Treasures have arrived in one piece ready to be shown to an interested public. Here is the Fee of $Credits$ credits that was agreed. Thank you again!</t>
 <t id="311">Please wait here, I'll just going to dock the Transporter.</t>
 <t id="312">I think it would be a good idea for you to leave this station and get as far away as possible. Don't dawdle as you might loose more than you think!</t>

I must say Elena is quite impressed, - and knowing her business acumen, she is far from easy to impress. While we both know that there is more than a little of your father's sector-jumping spirit in you, we still feel it would be wise for you to take the time to build up a decent foundation in terms of both factories you own, as well as credits freely available to you.\n\nI know you're on your way to the Паранід sectors to meet Bret, but you should still use this time you have now wisely, trade and expand your horizons beyond the here and now. There may be events and trials beyond what you may see immediately ahead of you, you must be prepared. You need to ensure your ship is as ready for the unforeseen as you are. Bret will be waiting once you have added a few credits and perhaps a few factories and ship upgrades to your name, if anything he has almost as much of a traders eye as you do so you can bet he'll be trading too, though knowing Bret, perhaps not in the same line of wares![/text]</t>

There can and will be times when you will be thankful for the extra resources you have accumulated. Be prepared. Схованка Ньяни will still be there once you have added a few credits and perhaps a few factories or ship upgrades to your name, I've taken the opportunity of getting in touch with Saya and Bret to let them know you may be a little late![/text]</t>

Great work in , your skill in locating the secret base has raised a few eyebrows amongst many of the veterans in the Аргон military. Elena has been in touch with me again, she has asked me that I strongly recommend to you that now would be the perfect time to consolidate your position and business. She has been more than impressed with your performance so far - but she still feels it would be wise for you to take some time to build up a decent base of both factories and ships that you own, as well as credits freely available to you. Use this time you have now wisely, trade and expand your credit balance as far as possible. As I've said many times before, there can and will be times when you will be thankful for the extra resources you have accumulated. I cannot stress that enough.\n\nWhile Mik Balser has confirmed that you are to return to Аргон Prime to meet with me, I must point out there is no immediate need for you to return as I am currently engaged in further research on the data from the AP Gunner's ship computer. When you have taken on board the advice that Elena and I have given, feel free to return to the Аргон One, at which point we will discuss further the plans we have in regards to our newfound enemy.[/text]</t>

There may be something that you might want to take a look at though. It's a Strafe Drive extension! You know since I had mine installed, can't live without it. Absolutely essential when you're under attack and can't shake laserfire from your rear. You can get them from Boron, Паранід and Спліт equipment docks I think. The upgrade allows you to move sideways as well as forward at the same time. If you're going to go through the Ксенон sectors with Saya, - you really need to get the Strafe Drive plugged into your ships systems. Without it you'll be a sitting duck, and I'm not going to be sitting on your rear waiting to rescue your sorry behind if you eject! Anyway, that's all Jules. Catch you on the other side of the Ксенон sectors. Keep an eye on Saya for me, she's too cocky for her own good![/text]</t>

Is there something wrong with your weaponry? I must ask you to return at best speed, we are at a critical point in our battle with the Хаак in this sector, we cannot afford to be without your skill both as a pilot and combat veteran. Our forces urgently need your guidance in dealing with one of the Хаак motherships that is threatening our fleet. Saya and Bret are doing their best to work with our Force Commanders, but there are several waves that have advanced formation and evasion tactics that you have proven to be able to counteract - in particular when you jumped to the Хаак sector recently. While you do not have the pleasure of flying the Hydra at this time, you still have the experience that we so desperately need. We can but hope that your presence will push the tide in our favour. Godspeed Julian, in this, our darkest stazura, we will either stand or fall. Make your way back to us while there is still time...[/text]</t>

I believe that you may still be unaware of the consequences of your inability to follow clear and specific orders from Cmdr Danna. We had hoped to make a stand against the Хаак at Omicron, send them a clear signal that we were not a race who would lay down or accept their invasion without question. In that respect, we have failed. Several mizuras ago we lost all contact with our forces in Омікрон Ліри. Scout vessels were sent in to establish the current status of our fleet. We have lost, Mr Gardna. We have lost everything.\n\nOn behalf of Аргон Command I regretfully inform you that Commander Danna, your father Kyle Brennan, Bret Serra, Saya Kho and all forces operating in the sector have been wiped out. In addition to this, the lives of 80 million people, an entire sectors population, have been lost in the destruction of Омікрон Ліри's home planet. There is nothing left but battle debris.\n\nWhile this loss cannot be placed directly on your shoulders, we feel that your inaction had left little chance for the forces in Omicron to make any level of coordinated effort in repelling the Хаак or rescuing Kyle Brennan. The ghosts of many people, good people, will remain with us in the wake of this immeasurable loss. May you remember them well.[/text]</t>

 <t id="2">Keep going pilot-you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining to deliver the goods</t>
 <t id="3">That's great! You've managed to get all of the $WARES$ that we asked you to deliver to us here at the $HERE$. We're quite impressed with your ability to haul cargo on a deadline. For the $AMOUNT$ units you returned to us you have received a total of $REWARDSOFAR$. Here's the additional $BONUSREWARD$ as per our agreement, as well as keep your name on our lists for future work. Thanks for your help, see you in $THISSECTOR$ soon!</t>
 <t id="4">Well, even though you were a good pilot in our books, it looks like you don't have the necessary standing to deliver the $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ to the station. I'm afraid we're going to have to take your name off the list of pilots we can use. Sorry but the contract has been cancelled. </t>
 <t id="5">Okay, it looks like you have been authorized to proceed with this mission.

You will have these details retained in your ships log, so if you ever need to remind yourself, the details will be there. I'm going to start you off with a few suggestions on where you may find some $WARES$. Actually there's quite a few, here's some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="6">When did you last check your ship? You need at least freight size $TKCLASS$ to accept this mission. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="7">Excellent! You've brought back some $WARES$ to our $HERE$. The total you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship up to now. Remember that there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to obtain more of the goods we require. </t>
 <t id="8">I see that you've been having some problems... Haven't found any of the wares we require yet? Well, you still have $TIMELEFT$ to get us the full amount of $WARES$. If you manage to get them all, we will be happy to supply you with the extra payment of $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="9">Well it looks like you're out of time! We can't accept any more wares from you. You managed to ship a total of $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ to us! Your total payment for what you delivered to us was $REWARDSOFAR$. Thanks for helping us out pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="10">Well, that's something we've never seen before. You've actually managed to get none of the $WARES$ that we asked you to ship back to our $HERE$. You have to be one of the worst haulage pilots we have ever employed. I'm sorry but since you didn't provide us with anything, we're not willing to provide you with any payment. Seems that the promise of $BONUSREWARD$ on getting all the $WARES$ didn't effect your motivation one little bit. Go Away, I'm telling all the factories around here how bad you are!!</t>

 <t id="101">[Title]Factory Failure Creates Opening for Additional Trade Run[/title]\n\n[justify]Greetings to all. One of our main competitors has been hit by disaster as all its transport pilots have suddenly taken industrial action and walked out on strike. Being low on resources, they will be unable to supply all their customers, who will be forced to come to us. So here at the $HERE$ we need to quickly build up our stocks and to do so we need at least another $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. However all our own pilots are busy, which means we have an opening for a pilot. The applicant for this mission has only $TIMELIMIT$ to get all $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ back to us here. In return we will reimburse $UNITPRICE$ per unit, in addition to that the willing pilot must be in a ship that can take $TKCLASS$ sized cargo and hold at least a standing of $TRADERANK$. We are working on a tight schedule as we have made clear, so if all the $WARES$ are delivered within $TIMELIMIT$ then up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ will be paid.[/justify] </t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining. We're counting on you to get the $WARES$ to us so please don't let us down.</t>
 <t id="103">What!? Are you done already? It seems that we now have all of the $WARES$ that we requested to be shipped to this $HERE$. Good work! You were quick to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. Total standard payment you got for all the wares was $REWARDSOFAR$. We are more than happy to pay you the $BONUSREWARD$ that was promised on top, both payments have now been transferred. If you ever need more work in $THISSECTOR$, you know where to find us. </t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THISSECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the station to complete your shipment of the $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about your actions. </t>
 <t id="105">Great, we have your details confirmed as a registered pilot we can trust, so you have the green light on this mission. Here's a heads-up on the mission again. We need a total of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ delivered to the $HERE$ located in $THISSECTOR$. $UNITPRICE$ is what you will get per ware taken from your ship. You need to ship the last batch of cargo to us in less than $TIMELIMIT$. $BONUSREWARD$ on delivery of all goods. As for suggestions on where to go? I'm surprised you've asked, considering you have a ranking as high as $TRADERANK$. Anyway, there are quite a few stations you could go to for $WARES$. Here are some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="106">Get lost - can't you read or is your translator broken? Your ship needs to be able to carry $TKCLASS$ freight at least to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="107">Great work pilot! We now have some $WARES$ in our hangar bay. The amount you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship to us up to now. Just to remind you, there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to get more of the goods we need back to our $HERE$. </t>
 <t id="108">Well it looks like you haven't been able to get any of the wares we need yet. Is there a problem with your navigation software? Well you still have $TIMELEFT$ to bring us the full amount of $WARES$. Remember if you are able to get them all, we will be able to pay you an additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="109">I'm sorry but it appears that the deadline for shipping wares to our $HERE$ has ended. You have clocked up a total of $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ we received. Thanks for all your help pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="110">I don't believe it, you couldn't even get one shipment of $WARES$ back to our $HERE$. What were you doing? Catching spaceflies? Next time we urgently need resources to continue production, we'll hire someone who knows what they're doing. We'll be promising the sum of $BONUSREWARD$ for that pilot to complete the shipments instead. As for you, perhaps you ought to take up another line of work, ferrying passengers for example, if you can get there on time..</t>

There was an engine plasma venting incident recently in the docking area. Unfortunately the transporters cargo bay doors were open at the time. This is a common mistake made by many new transporter pilots. Sadly, the hold was full of our normal supply of $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ and they have become contaminated. We urgently need a new supply if we are to maintain production. The mission is simple. Make sure your ship can carry $TKCLASS$ freight or higher, fly out and deliver back to us within $TIMELIMIT$ the replacement $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. In return for this favour, we will pay a fixed rate $UNITPRICE$ per unit delivered. Get as many as you can. If you can supply us the full amount within the time limit, we will pay up to $BONUSREWARD$ extra. Anyone interested?[/justify]</t>

 <t id="1">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galaxy Wide Martial Arts Tournament Concludes[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The final bout of the no holes barred IGF tournament ended today at 5.45am SGT with the defeat of Аргон 'Ta Shee-Do' grandmaster Nathan Gunner by Shin Zein, the current Спліт 'Pinja' champion after an epic two and a half hour match that left many of the spectators in awe. &quot;It was incredible&quot; said Ta Shee-Do enthusiast Michael Kormach, &quot;Most of the time it was just two blurs going at it in the centre but despite the fact that I was tired, hungry, and desperately needed to relieve myself I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ring. Just crazy.&quot;\n\nThe controversial competition, which has been running for five jazuras now, pits a maximum of two fighters per race against each other in a series of sudden death rounds until a Galactic Champion and Runner Up are determined. Winner is determined by knockout or submission and the final cash prize is substantial. Shin Zein was not available for comment but we were able to speak to a spokesperson for Nathan who claimed, &quot;I have talked to Mr Gunner this morning - he is in good spirits and expects to resume training for the next tournament as soon as he is able to. This is provided that the spine reconstruction surgery goes as planned.&quot; he added.\n\nSpec Harley - Sports Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>

All 5 nations \(Аргон Boron Теладі Спліт Паранід\) enter a basic-level ship which has been stripped down to a standard chassis and driven by solar-sail propulsion. A route is chosen to pass through a number of planetary sectors, normally pirate-free. Пірат even keep clear of the race as it draws too much attention to their activities.\n\nSolar sailing, once popular in early space travel is now the sport of Kings and Governments. The winner of the last tournament were the Boron, who are hosting this jazura's event. The start of the race will begin at Королівський Вінець, where the Boron Queen will fire the starting cannon-laser.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="3">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Boron trade in Teladianium jumps to new demand heights[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Trading in Teladianium with the Boron does have its problems. Apart from the distances involved, the goods themselves are increasingly at greater risk from Пірат who are rumoured to be hired by rival factory owners to attack transport ships. Ships that do get through however, bring large profits to their owners. It may be worth investing in some support craft, or purchasing additional weaponry. The profits you gain in success will more than pay for such small investments.\n\nNili Ma - Galaxy Network - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="4">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Паранід demand for Bio-Gas grows[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The trade in Bio-gas with the Паранід is a difficult business. The risk of pirate attack becomes more of a problem for transporters as they have to travel further to buy and sell this precious commodity. Ships that succeed though are sure to bring profits to their owners. The use of additional support craft and weaponry will ofcourse raise your chances for success and profit.\n\nNili Ma - Galaxy Network - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="6">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]&quot;What's With These Пірат?; Miner shows 'concern'&quot;[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Take a &quot;space-walk&quot; in any ship and you're bound to come across space Пірат . They fly around as if their activity is legit- slowly and conspicuously. Such bold activity should make anyone wonder why and how they could do such with &quot;all&quot; the police and government around, which in-turn makes them think of how much police and government vehicles are actually in use.\n\nA miner who just came from a days shift in asteroid-laden, and also home to a pirate base, Ore-Belt questioned an officer as to why there is the base around yet no assaults against it. The officer was &quot;too busy&quot; attending to the shiny new hull of his M6 in his dreams to answer the question. The miner, frustrated at such a lax attitude for the harsh terrain of space made sure he was up by sending a sound pulse to his ship via a squash mine. The miner was spared from imprisonment as he hadn't harmed him, but now he's been put on surveillance for any dangerous activity.\n\nPil Mino - Galaxy Network[/justify][/text]</t>

After checking the Navcharts the Captain noticed he was on a collision course with the South Gate in Пагорб Аладни. The navigator's quarters were later searched and two bottles of Аргон whisky was found along with some spaceweed.\n\nIt is said the Navigator, an ex Гонер, had spiritual conflicts. &quot;He will be placed in hospital for rehabilitation as soon as we dock at the shipyard,&quot; said the Captain.\n\nJanit Brena - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="8">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Phased Shockwave Generator[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Phased Shockwave Generator&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon was developed by a rare alliance between the Теладі and Паранід. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave. This weapon has many uses; one is missile defence, and another is multiple fighter defence. The weapon is quite unique in that it is the first 'area affect' weapon to come out on the open market. The Паранід decided to sell this in attempt to boost their poor economy, and it has proven quite a success since its release. The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires special machinery.\n\nSafety is also an issue; the prototype station exploded when the main matter-compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has been adapted with machines taking over most of the dangerous phases of production. The Phased packages are developed in a vacuum at zero gravity. If the package reacts with photon energy - more commonly known as light - the package will start to expand. Another requirement therefore is a that the manufacturing process takes place entirely in the dark.\n\nThe energy is then compressed using subspace compression technology, similar to that used within cargo bays. When it expands the energy sends out phased waves that affect both the shields and hull of a vessel. Some pilots have described its effects as, 'Being stuck in an Ion Storm'.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="9">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Ion Disruptor[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Ion Disruptor&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nDeveloped by Boron Scientists this weapon is unlike any weapon encountered. The Ion Disruptor fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. The stream is then ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, whilst leaving the hull relatively untouched.\n\nAlthough this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps to high Boron standards. Although simple enough to explain how it works, manufacturing the weapon is different matter. It is a complicated process that involves building a device that can create a stream of ionised particles. This in itself is dangerous. The process can be seen in one of the Borons Published Documents by Dr Halilo Wo - &quot;Processes and Functions of the Ion&quot;[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="10">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - The Mass Driver[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;The Mass Driver&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi-barrelled cannon that is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.\n\nIt inflicts damage not due to the power of individual projectiles but through the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the nature of this weapons ammunition it has almost no effect on a ships shield but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain because all energy requirements are supplied by the ammunition.\n\nCurrently the weapon can only be fitted to Аргон and Спліт ships. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself, a small armour piercing shell with a micro explosive core encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered. This is possible by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy, and an explosive micro-charge designed to propel the shell at high velocity towards its target. This pack contains 200 rounds.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Riots in Priests Pity.[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Demonstrating Paranids, angry at the &quot;Sacred Relic of Hope&quot; being moved from Жаль Жреця to Trinity Sanctum, exploded into violence when Паранід Police forces moved in to restore order to the area. Police forces were driven back by over 13,000 protestors as the scene developed into chaos.\n\nThe protestors later took over the police station and held the police forces captive in their own interrogation cells. Emperor Xaar gave orders to send in the 191st Паранід Army Division to quell the angry mob. Camera teams were forced out of the area as the army brought order back to the area. They have been no official reports of casualties and information of exactly how the situation is still Невідомий and probably always will be.\n\nJanit Brano - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Photon Pulse Cannons[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Photon Pulse Cannons&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nFirst Developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Аргон, the Photon Pulse Cannon is a firm favourite of the Аргон Military, who then sold the original designs on to other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. The more powerful version of this weapon include a super-conducting coilset and a proton filter that makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields.\n\nThe stations that produce them were the original Weapons Research Laboratories that developed this technology for the Аргон. Professor Bydnah still works on updating the PPC weapon and has recently become the head of Аргон Weapons Research in Омікрон Ліри, representing the Grand Sonra University.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="13">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Thousands dead as asteroid pushed into planet[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The planet Oceania in Рай Менелаї is in a state of shock after an asteroid hit by a TL class transporter was sent tumbling into the planet's atmosphere. The death toll is currently Невідомий but is thought to number well over 12,000. The gigantic transporter was attempting to set up a silicon mine on a nearby asteroid and nudged the mountain sized rock onto a collision course. The Boron pilot, Fumi No, was tested for narcotics and was found to be under the influence of both spaceweed and Аргон whisky. If found guilty of flying while intoxicated, Fumi No faces a prison sentence of no less than 8 Jazura and his Master's licence revoked. Critics have protested that the length of sentence available is not severe enough compared to the destruction and loss of life caused.\n\nAid convoys are being sent by the Аргон, Гонер and other Boron sectors. The Boron government has set up a charity for all affected and all Boron government factories have sent a percentage of their profits to help. Anyone worried about family members who may have been on the planet at the time are advised to contact the administrator of the nearest Boron trading station for details on the latest updates.\n\nThere will be a memorial service held in the Гонер Temple in Південно-Західна Хмарна База. Anyone wishing to attend should contact the Гонер for details.\n\nKrimanckussut - Current Affairs Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="14">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Competing pirate groups cause havoc in frontier sectors[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Reports have been coming in about rival pirate groups setting up competitions between themselves. The recent spate of thefts, ship hijackings, and smuggling incidents have led to major police investigations which have revealed that the pirate groups are ranking themselves in a league table format. This league table seems to be Спліт into two sections. The first of these sections involves speed records for various activities including the top times for completing gate races, quickest ship hijacking and fastest escape from police attention. The other section relates to the amount of credits gained from certain activities. Examples include the highest price for a single smuggling run of contraband products or the highest price for the sale of a stolen ship.\n\nA copy of the &quot;high credits&quot; section of the leader board was recently obtained by Аргон military forces in a raid on the pirate base in the sector Пояс Руди. The list was a major find and has been used in bringing over 20 Пірат to justice. More of the criminals are still being hunted but the Аргон are confident that when they are found, the criminals will be convicted by the compelling evidence against them. Tomes Burnett, a spokesperson for the Аргон military said &quot;These criminals must be stopped. Not only are they breaking the law, they are making a game out of it. It is a blatant insult to law enforcers of every race as well as to all law abiding citizens throughout the known systems. This cannot and will not be tolerated.&quot; He then went on to remind all individuals that financial rewards are offered to any sentient being who helps to reduce the pirate problem, provided that they are in possession of a police licence.\n\nKunklu Ni - Legal Correspondent, Galnet News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="15">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Particle Accelerator Cannon[/title][text cols='1'][justify]&quot;Particle Accelerator Cannon&quot;\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon is usually found on larger fighter craft, destroyers and on some battleships and carriers.\nThey have been around since the Аргон Weapons Society was founded near the beginning of the Ксенон conflict. The first of it's class were developed when the Паранід and Аргон were friends and both governments were focused on developing a weapon more powerful than those they currently had in service.\n\nA particle accelerator was entered into the standard laser to try to increase the speed of the weapon's output. The results were amazing an almost 200% increase in output. The PAC was born. The particles are accelerated to two thirds the speed of light. At that point they are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse.\n\nThe effect can be quite devastating, especially to a target ship's hull. A direct hit has been known to actually dent hull plating.\nOver the jazuras, the PAC has evolved into three types, the Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Each one has a slight modification to the polarisation and focusing of the particles.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="16">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Station races spread to the Теладі and Спліт[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The outlawed game Station Racing has spread from Аргон space to Теладі space and now also involves the Спліт. The dangerous game involves an agreement on the award and then the station to land on. The Аргон are believed to just like the rush of the race, the Теладі just like the gambling for credits and the Спліт like the danger and being able to embarrass the loser.\n\nNo casualties in the Теладі and Спліт sectors yet but in Аргон space there have been many deaths when station doors have not opened quickly enough for the ship. New laws are being discussed by all three races to keep the space around stations free from these daredevils.\n\nOmon Misar - Culture Correspondent - GalNet News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="17">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Are they still with us?[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Гонер scientists today are once again on the hunt to determine if a pile of rocks spotted on a moon in the Montalaar system is of alien origin. Sources from the Гонер temple say that they have every reason to now believe that there may have once been activity on the moon. This comes after many jazuras of denying such a claim since the failed expedition several Jazura ago when the noted Professor Autland went missing whilst in transit to the earlier site.\n\nSo get those space-picks out and start digging! let us know what you find!\n\nJako Seldon - Current Affairs Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="18">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Ксенон Rock?[/title][text cols='2'][justify]We all like a good laugh and every now and again we get one from those brain boxes in the Гонер sect. Currently digging on a sandy moon they cannot quite decide if it is a Ксенон artefact or a lump of rock. We have bets on that it is a rock, what do you think?\n\nIt gives us at GalNet another good laugh to witness another mess-up by these people that are supposed to be leading scientists.

I'm sure questions will be asked and some poor soul will be blamed. That it took so much military hardware to attack an obsolete Ксенон relic leaves us all with a sense of bewilderment. Surely they must have known the scientists were there and could have given them a call before landing.\n\nAnyway, let us hope the Аргон Military are just as responsive if there is a real threat.\n\nJako Seldon - Current Affairs Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>

The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many jazuras of research and development until it could be placed on the open market.\nA major drawback of earlier models being when the weapon was fired a large buildup of plasma remained in the weapons main firing zone. When firing a second time this plasma would ignite causing a large fireball, destroying the craft it was on.\n\nThis was originally resolved by adding a plasma sink into the weapons main design, purging the weapon of all excess plasma between shots. This technology was developed by a now famous Паранід Scientist, LarkElSung, however it has since been made obsolete.\nIn 420 an alternative was added to this weapon to replace the plasma sink, a Boron biological plasma filter. The regenerative properties of the Boron technology means that this filter never needs replacing.\n\nToday HEPT's as they are now known, are invaluable. They can only be used on larger fighters. Any M3 fitted with any of the derivatives of the HEPT is indeed a very powerful craft. As with all technology, new weapons are coming out all the time, who knows one day the HEPT could look like a Спліт child's toy.[/justify][/text]</t>

No one actually knows by whom or when the weapon was first developed. The IRE, as they are better known, are mainly used on scout class M5 craft. They require very little power to fire, and they have a rapid recharge rate.\n\nToday IRE weapons are considered to be of the least desired weapons as they have little or no affect on modern high powered shields such as the 25MJ or the 125MJ shield. But against fighters of the Scout class they are extremely valuable.\n\nArgon and Теладі Scientists keep studying new ways of expanding the technological uses of the IRE weapon, although there is very little that can be done to further this technology. It is expected that in the next few jazuras IRE weapons will be taken off the market as power generator technology means that PAC weapons could be fitted to M5 craft.\n\nCould the day of using IRE weapons to cut the Celebratory Argnu be here?

If it is true, the probe will probably use the latest jump-drive technology in a bid to discover more sectors that can be connected to the existing network.\n\nWhile conventional colonization has proceeded apace in recent jazura, there are problems as more and more potential flashpoints between the various governments are created.

 <t id="35">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Call for All Races Archaeology Conference[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Following discoveries across the known sectors, ranging from evidence of prehistoric proto-species to indications of widespread ancient civilisations, a number of eminent archaeologists and historians have called for a conference of all races' experts to discuss the findings. The idea is only at the proposal stage and is sure to encounter many difficulties, not least where to find a neutral venue at which to hold such a conference. However, the notion has the backing of the Boron, Аргон and the Goners. It has even gained the support of one noted Паранід archaeologist, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit.\n\nHowever, an official response to the idea from the Паранід Imperial Antiquities Section has not yet been received. The Теладі Profit Guild has an extensive ancient artefacts programme but this seems more dedicated to selling such items rather than studying them. Спліт find archaeology almost incomprehensible and they have but a few isolated experts. Speaking out, Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit said: &quot;I have petitioned the Priest-Dukes on this matter and I feel sure they will acknowledge the wisdom of sharing knowledge of the past. Naturally I must be bound by their interpretation of the sacred texts and so while I support the idea I cannot yet say if I will be there.&quot;\n\nLeading proponent of the idea, Professor Daka Ro of the Royal Boron Archaeological Survey said: &quot;scholar of Priest-Historian Losadtimanckit's calibre could not attend the conference. I feel sure we will find a way to hold this important event.&quot;\n\nYnojygeos Gossojdraes Alylais I - Science Correspondent GalNet News [/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="36">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Concerns Over Security At Weapons Facilities[/title][text cols='2'][justify]With the wide dispersal of weapons and shielding factories throughout the known universe, concern is growing that security may be overstretched. Most governments have allowed private corporations to take responsibility for the production of beam weapons and missile technology. Even some of the new weaponry developments are being put into production in relatively widespread sectors. While all such facilities have their own security forces, there is a real danger that opportunistic raiders could attack in force and seize large quantities of very powerful missiles and energy cannons.\n\nWhile governments are unhappy at the situation, most say there is no alternative to dispersed production if efficient distribution of weapons is to be maintained. They also point to the need to ensure resources for their factories are within easy reach. Теладі Profit Guild official Etofomeos Ilalios Ulylues VIII said: &quot;There is a need to balance practicality with security. Not to mention profit.&quot; Аргон Federation Admiral Homer Anselm commented: &quot;We need our weapons where we can get at them. If this means that others may be able to get at them we will have to deal with that situation. With crushing force if need be.&quot;\n\nOberon Kallan - Security Correspondent GalNet News [/justify][/text]</t>

Food companies across space have been complaining of BoFu exploding into shreds when the containers are opened. Somehow an excess of Boron BoGas appears to have been introduced into the cubed BoFu and this produces the explosion when the lids are popped.\n\nQuite why somebody would play such a joke on the Boron BoFu industry is a mystery but it follows a pattern of similar strange incidents. The Теладі Nostrop Oil corporations were recently plagued by highly-carbonated Nostrop being introduced into their product lines. The resulting &quot;fizzy Nostrop&quot; is said to have coated many Теладі with oil from head to foot. One Nostrop producer has gone so far as to offer a bounty for the head of the responsible party.\n\nElsewhere, the Паранід have discovered several consignments of rubber Soja Husks and the Аргон have found Cahoona Steaks that &quot;moo&quot; at anyone trying to cut them up. These latter were found to have been implanted with miniature sound-chips. There are no reports of such pranks being played on the Спліт, though their Rastar Oil Producers Council recently held an emergency meeting.\n\nDaka Ra - Business Correspondent GalNet News [/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="38">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Illegal Trade Market May Rival Trade in Legal Goods[/title][text cols='2'][justify]It is being suggested by some security and business sources that the trade in illegal goods may rival that in legitimate commodities on a per credit calculation. Dealing in prohibited alcohol and drugs, outlawed weapons systems and even the scourge of slavery have long been regarded as a problem by some governments, notably the Аргон Federation and the Boron Kingdom.\n\nOther governments regard the issues with greater flexibility, the Паранід having no scruples when it comes to weaponry and the Теладі quite openly tolerating the drugs trade. In addition, the Спліт dependence on slave labour means that this evil market is ever a source of profit for those willing to engage in the trade.\n\nThere are large profits to be made by those willing to risk the wrath of governments that frown on such trading. The penalties can be severe and slavers, in particular, should be warned that the Аргон and Boron will not look kindly on their business. While the illegal trade can be profitable, so too can the trade in legitimate goods. Technology and valuable foodstuffs will bring good, safe and legal profits to all who deal in them. As ever, the trader must choose between speed and danger or steady profit and safety.\n\nDaka Ra - Business Correspondent GalNet News [/justify][/text]</t>

The Аргон-based licensed security and mercenary organisation believes that Пірат and illegal mercenary groups have found kidnapping and ransoming to be a particularly lucrative business. This terrible activity has increased far more quickly than the still steadily rising drug trade.\n\nFree Company spokesperson Wilhelm Uhlan said: &quot;Kidnapping is a relatively easy business for an experienced pirate. They pounce on an unsuspecting trader or small passenger ship. They send off demands. Those that get paid for they release, those that don't they sell into slavery. They can't help but make credits.&quot;\n\nFree Company Associates believes the answer is to increase licensing of private security organisations so as to plug the gaps in the overstretched governmental and police fleets. Others fear that such a move would flood space with heavily-armed flotillas under no central control.

The popular Аргон sport of Hardball has gained a considerable following among Boron and Теладі and they are joining those travelling from Аргон outer worlds to the centres of this sport. The influx of tourists to Місяць Рінго, spiritual home of Hard Ball, is particularly striking.\n\nThe Теладі gambling games of Roulestar and Теладі Eye are also attracting much tourism and there are dedicated gambling cruises between various famous Теладі casinos. Gamblers from all races are spending their hard-earned credits in this way. Even the Спліт, who have normally restricted themselves to betting on Ghok Deathmatches, have caught the bug.\n\nThen there is Ghok Deathmatching itself. Bizarrely this seems to have created a bridge between the Аргон and the Спліт. Certainly some Аргон, perhaps not the most reputable of characters, are taking the time to travel to major Ghok events.

Fortunately, this investment appears to have paid off and the need for larger military forces, as the colonies expand, and the increase in armed civilian traffic is resulting in profit for all concerned.\n\nWhile many new weapons systems are still relatively restricted, a number can be purchased and fitted to appropriate craft. It is noticeable that the ship market has also risen and with it demand for shields and basic fittings such as boost equipment, trading extensions and other essentials of civilian spaceflight.

Whatever the product, Nostrop, Soja, Argnu, Rastar or BoFu, profit is there to be made.\n\nNot all opportunities have been taken up and it is believed that food distribution can still increase up to five-fold in the outer territories, with profit being made across the board. A number of major players in the food distribution industry have acknowledged that they do not have the capacity to meet all demand and that much work exists for freelance traders and small cargo-carrier outfits.\n\nThe effects of this trend have even been seen in the relatively conservative station-building sector, with demand for agricultural facilities and processing factories rising steadily.

These incidents have brought to light a new threat from supposedly captured Ксенон fighters. They involve captured Ксенон ships reactivating and ramming stations when docking requests have been made. Studies of the wreckage of these fighters have revealed dormant memory cores in the fighters which activated under certain circumstances and execute hidden programming causing the kamikaze attacks. A team of Аргон and Boron scientists have been working\nhard to find a solution to this problem.\n\nSpokesperson York Selek has told us that all stations will be provided with the solution and will load it onto every ship. The package is a small memory wipe programme that will be broadcast to any captured ship the first time pilots access the board computer. The programme works automatically through the communication system and no extra effort will be necessary by the capturing pilot. All current privately owned Ксенон ships that have already docked have been memory wiped by station technicians and while there is no further threat from this type of attack, pilots are asked to remain vigilant for other forms of Ксенон trickery.\n\nFunfi Hu - Military Correspondent, Galnet News[/justify][/text]</t>

In very early stages of development, this technology would link each ship to the DNA of it's pilot. Upon ejection from the craft, the Гонер vehicle would effectively shut-down. Cargo space would be uncompressed, rendering the ship useless for carrying cargo, and further engine tunings and rudder tunings would not be possible. A new reaction system would also eject vital parts of the ship out along with the pilot, such as shields and navigation systems, thus hopefully bringing the attack to the attention of the local law enforcement ships. Whilst not perfect, as the ship could still be captured and sold, the improvements are welcome.

A smaller craft armed with 18 lasers and the then newly-developed 125MJ shields. It came into service during the Ксенон Conflict replacing the Аргон Century as the main battleship. The Century was later decommissioned as it was not powerful enough to cope with the demands of modern combat. The reign of the Titan continued for many jazuras until the Аргон government took on a radical new design. Longer than the Mk-I Titan, the MK-II Titan reminded people of Boron submarine craft. The design of the ship took many people by surprise, it was not like any other ship design to date.\n\nThe Mk-III is the latest design. More advanced technologies were used when constructing this vessel, and the Titan Mk-III was born. Its original purpose was to be an explorer ship as new jumpgates were being found. But the Mk-II design was showing its age. The length of the ship meant it was hard to manoeuvre. Poor forward velocity also made this problem worse. The rate of turn was so bad that it earned a nickname of &quot;Old Argnu&quot; as it was said that it was easier to steer a cow.\n\nMk-III is much improved. It is the current favourite with many Аргон Captains, although some still wish they could fly the much older Mk-I Titan and Century Craft their ancestors piloted.[/justify][/text]</t>

One concept that was on show by the first-jazura students, was a device that blocks missiles' targeting sensors, hence allowing for an Anti Missile Defence System. Another idea, was an ingenious robot that crawled along the hulls of large destroyers and carriers, repairing any damage done to the ship.\n\n&quot;I myself am going to take part in this program, teaching what I know to these students,&quot; said Professor Bydnah, who is responsible for some of the Аргон military's most recent weapon technologies. &quot;And who knows we may have an important development made in this very program.&quot;\n\nHanes Gisller - Science Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

It is reported that there have been a number of fatalities. The eastern continent is extensively settled by small but widely dispersed village and town communities. The continent is heavily wooded and provides lumber for the rest of the planet as well as specialist and exotic woods for the architectural and art materials trade. A burgeoning tourist economy has also been an increasingly valuable secondary industry in the region. All this is now threatened by massive flame-fronts extending over wide swathes of countryside.\n\nDisaster control authorities on the planet say that they simply do not have the resources to put the fires out and are concentrating on protecting settlements. It is hoped the fires will burn themselves out but the cost will be enormous. There is already talk of arson and sabotage with rumours of off-world visitors setting fires deliberately. Some have suggested that a foreign power is behind the fires and one direct accusation is against the Паранід. The suggestion here is that some particularly fine woods threatened the trade of inlaid majaglit furniture and other items. The Паранід government has flatly denied the accusation.\n\nHack Seldon - Social Affairs Correspondent IBC News [/justify][/text]</t>

The location is highly classified, however rumour tells us that it is set up in close vicinity to Південно-Західна Хмарна База, somewhere outside the main system area. Other rumours tells us also that the station has its own system drive, allowing it to fly freely in vicinity of the system. Officially no one has been confirmed having visited this station yet, quite probably because it is not marked on any maps. On the other hand even if anyone does manage to find it he probably will not be allowed to dock. A large number of laser turrets are armed to take out every ship approaching without permission.\n\nThe main goal of establishing this centre is to find weak points in jumpdrive construction and eliminate them, as well as to find new advantages that will improve the use of this drive. It could be, for example, a way to lower fuel cell consumption or even to jump without the use of energy cells. Another topic could be to improve the programming system which is used by the autopilot for setting the autojump sequence where there are no crew on board. This drive sometimes has been known to cause malfunctions where the ship using it would jump out near super-novae or the black holes.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

Two small pirate vessels moved directly into the path of an incoming trader ship as it passed through a gate, then following it inside the station, they murdered the trader and successfully avoided defence measures by taking out the main power supply generators.\n\nThis action left the dock unarmed for a few mizuras. Unfortunately it was enough time to choose from one of the many docked ships with potentially valuable cargo inside and take it out. The &quot;Bringer of life&quot;, a Lifter-type transport, owned by Jo Jovi, was blasted open in a moment. Fortunately the trader was not inside. Пірат then collected as much the remaining goods as they could and, destroying the main doors with rockets from inside, moved out the station. Using jumpdrive units they easily escaped with the booty.\n\n&quot;This unbelievable action is a shame for all police forces stationed in this system,&quot; stated the Аргон Minister of Defence, announcing also that those who didn't fulfil their duties would be severely punished. &quot;We cannot allow for such actions in the future,&quot; he continued &quot;and we have decided to assign a special fund for all necessary improvements, which will help Federal Аргон stations to feel safe from pirate activity&quot;.

This would be the single biggest recruitment in the history of our military.\n\nIt is still not clear how the Fleet plans to use these new recruits or how they will accommodate them. Recent appropriations have been heavily focused on upgrading Boron weaponry, not on building more ships or training installations. This has led to rumours that our leaders have been forced into an emergency recruitment drive for reasons they are not prepared to share with the public. A group of representatives in the Commonwealth Assembly plan to raise the issue at the earliest opportunity.\n\nIn a related move, it is rumoured that the Boron Secret Service is actively looking for independent pilots to carry out covert missions.

A spate of attacks in and around Простір Королеви is causing a lot of talk and even more nervousness amongst Boron traders.\n\nOnly one pilot, having survived the attacks, was too shaken to give a coherent report. The only words to have come from Hago Bli's mouth have been &quot;like vicious wolves&quot; and &quot;never saw them coming&quot;. He was one of the pilots doing the standard Nostrop Oil run between CEO's Buckzoid and Королівський Вінець when their convoy was attacked. All the freighters and escorts, including five Boron Eels, were blown to so much space dust. Miraculously, the attackers did not spot Bli who seems to have ejected rather more quickly than his colleagues. No-one knows whether the other pilots were taken for slaves or brutally killed in space.\n\nTraditionally, the sectors close to Королівський Вінець have been relatively free of pirate and mercenary activity. Rumours point to a band of renegade Пірат, possibly supported by one of the more warlike races. There are even those who suggest help from beyond known space, given the amazing effectiveness of these attacks.

A mitigating factor is the delivery time required for each ship, but with shipyards working overtime to fulfil orders, and with more orders anticipated it is unclear what the outcome will be.\n\nAnother factor that is of concern to Boron traders is the fact that according to manufacturing logs, virtually all TL class ships have had maximum cargo capacity upgrades specified as standard. While it is commonplace for traders to work their way up to such capacity over a period of time, the immediate order of full capacity TL ships is causing even greater tension.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent RCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Though Relalus is an accomplished master of the Kedja form of Fudo he was unprepared for the underhand techniques of the Спліт who, on the point of being grappled into submission, turned the match sour by ripping the liquid ammonium breathing system off the unfortunate captain. Faron Ceos, a spokesperson for the IGF had this to say about the tragedy, &quot;Although technically it is a no rules tournament there has always been an unspoken agreement about the survival requirements of the various competing species. Regardless, it cannot be said that Shin Zein did anything against the rules and his advancement to the next round was the only possible course of action.&quot; The Спліт went on to win the tournament, a competition that many are calling &quot;the Спліт ego trip&quot;.

Construction of the salination fabs is likely to start this jazura, however given the large size of this colony, complete salination will take at least 2 jazuras, meaning that colonization cannot commence until then.

But this day was a tragedy.\nFive Hundred Спліт workers from the Family Kaii and T'kr were killed as the station exploded when its newest ship attempted to depart. The Dragon heralded a new dawn for the Спліт people, but a fracture in its reactor casing caused a catastrophic explosion that resulted in the destruction of three other ships in construction.\n\nPrimary construction moved several jumps away to the nearest shipyards. Plans were drawn up to build a new series of shipyards, including smaller docks incase such an event should ever happen again. Kaii and T'kr never recovered after the death of their workers, and Family T'kr were held responsible for the reactor explosion. The leader of Family T'kr was executed and half of its assets seized. Kaii lost nothing as they were employed to assist T'kr.\n\nConstruction of the Dragon re-started, - the first two of the Mk II prototypes were lost in Невідомий circumstances and, a third ship disappeared without a trace. Спліт pilots consider the Dragon to be eternally cursed. Haunted by the souls of those who died in the incident. Every jazura on the anniversary of the explosion, all Спліт spend two mizuras remembering the dead.\n\nGu't Nnt - Documentary Writer SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

No professional gladiator has previously retired in the history of the sport. It has been a universal rule that professionals die in the arena. However, no previous professional has survived beyond 40 jazuras of deathmatching, let alone 50.\n\nIt is a mark of the skill of Toqaw t'Fvtt that he has reached this stage. It is said that the doughty fighter was persuaded to retire by the Professional Deathmatchers Club. They have offered him a contract as supervisor of a planned academy of deathmatchers. No shame devolves on Toqaw t'Fvtt, particularly as he fights with a prosthetic leg and arm. The PDC may be concerned that a way for older deathmatchers to retire should be established. A number of professionals are heading towards 50 jazuras of deathmatching and the Club is concerned to retain their experience to the benefit of all Спліт.\n\nJarac t'Mttj - Sports Correspondent SFN News [/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="56">[article/][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]Innovative Stress Reliever Withdrawn from sale[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Many of you may own a Nowhey. For those of you that don't, this clever little planet-designed gadget was aimed at hot-headed Спліт everywhere. Being a mighty warrior and a little short tempered is not always a good combination! So the Nowhey was designed. Made from innovative flexible materials, it is about half the size of a Спліт and virtually indestructible. In a moment of rage, it can be stabbed, punched, kicked, bitten and even whipped against a bulkhead and it will not break. It was designed to let angry Спліт take out their vengeance and temper without hurting anyone or damaging anything. Sadly, the plan has backfired. It seems that most Спліт are even more furious at not being able to damage the Nowhey, and have started looking for the next best thing, notably each other. After a three fold increase in fatalities in the last wozura alone, the Nowhey has now been withdrawn from sale and all use of them banned in public places. This should be a lesson to all Спліт - a warrior's spirit can never be subdued.\n\nCho't Lt, Social Affairs Correspondent, SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Never straying far from the jump gates, Спліт forces were able to destroy many smaller Ксенон craft before jumping back to safety prior to attack by a Ксенон capital ship. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a cowardly way for the Спліт to fight, but merely using the appropriate tactics for this situation - pilots were keen to emphasize this.\n\nThe attacks were made in a successful attempt to stem similar style raids by the Ксенон into Спліт sectors. Whilst this will work over the short term, the ultimate goal is of course to destroy the Ксенон Shipyard. No such attempt was made during this recent assault. Over 30 Ксенон ships have been destroyed so far, and military commanders are hailing this as a great victory. Unconfirmed reports put Спліт fatalities at less than 5. We shall not forget them.\n\nFui't Plt, Foreign Affairs Correspondent, SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Паранід police have no choice but to let the TL drift further out into deep space and destroy it.

 <t id="7">[article/][author]{1294,40}[/author][title]Arson Accusation an Insult to the Race[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The well-known theologian and commentator Geomanckolok has described as &quot;insulting to the race&quot; the suggestion that &quot;Невідомий Паранід&quot; may be behind the fires raging on Nyana's Planet in the Аргон system of Схованка Ньяни. The fires on the Аргон planet have devastated large portions of the forests of that world and there are believed to have been a number of deaths. The Аргон government has made no direct accusation or even hinted at the involvement of any external power. Even so, sources in Схованка Ньяни have whispered that a &quot;foreign power&quot; was &quot;jealous&quot; of the fine and exotic woods of Nyana's Planet. This has been taken to be a reference to the Priest Dukes and their natural concern to maintain the majaglit industry and in particular the fine inlaid furniture trade.\n\nWhile the Priest Dukes have denied the possibility of any Паранід involvement in the possible arson on Nyana's Planet, they have not issued any further comment and are believed to be reluctant to make an issue out of the accusation given that it is not coming from the Аргон government itself. Even so, says Geomanckolok, the Аргон should &quot;apologise for this vicious slur and make reparations.

The planet, in independent Olmancketslat's Treaty sector, has long been settled by a variety of renegades and refugees from the space powers. Аргон, Паранід, Спліт and Теладі individuals and families have established cities and independent statelets in profusion across the face of the planet. Only Boron malcontents are lacking in numbers due to the somewhat arid atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe official view of the Паранід Empire and the Priest Dukes on behalf of the Priest Emperor is that the war is of little consequence to Паранід interests. The sector does not sit astride any unique routes across space, indeed has always been something of a side market for the Паранід Empire's merchants. For whatever reason the Спліт Families appear to regard it as important enough to send troops there. Alternatively, some observers of the Спліт have suggested that the troops are being so readily sent in order to give them combat experience. It seems likely that the troops will gain that in abundance as it is reported that the AFS rebels are hiring offworld mercenaries specialising in ground combat. The AFS control a number of resource-rich regions and appear well able to finance large mercenary armies. The Спліт involvement is by no means a guarantee of a quick end to this war.\n\nLoakmanckelong - Foreign Affairs Correspondent IPN News [/justify][/text]</t>

The Joint Caravan was a plan to run armed convoys through independent and outer territories using Теладі and Boron naval vessels.\n\nThe scheme was conceived by Profit Protection Admiral Betndyis Ylyliys Bywumys V and she commented: &quot;The Boron Royal Navy is obsessed with its rigid notions of command and loyalty to the Crown. We Теладі respect the Boron Crown but cannot allow the archaic views of Royal Officers to result in loss of profits. The Теладі-Boron Joint Caravan is indefinitely suspended.&quot;\n\nThe Central All-Теладі Stock Exchange rallied at the news, an indication of the market's dissatisfaction with the plan as a whole and its relief that the project is suspended. This suspension is likely to be permanent and the remarks of certain Boron naval officers have led to formal complaints being lodged with the Boron High Commissioner in Сейзвел.\n\nGyssyndrues Mudymos Ynaquas I - Military Affairs Correspondent CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>

While some have suggested this was caused by maintenance failures, the hot theory is that a terrorist or mercenary faction has carried out a bombing. Аргон security are hunting for any and all leads that could point to one group over another. It is reported that the Аргон are even looking hard at the activities of the other powers, though it is highly unlikely that even the Спліт would directly sponsor an attack on an Аргон station.\n\nWhile it would be highly embarrassing for the Аргон authorities if this explosion does turn out to be the result of negligence and therefore a simple accident, it would be far more interesting if a terrorist group has decided to embark on a campaign of indiscriminate bombings on targets in Аргон space. The latter would tie up many security resources that the Аргон are currently relying on in their anti-piracy operations. If this were to happen it could herald many new opportunities in Аргон space.\n\nOberon Waellsly - Crime Correspondent MIN News [/justify][/text]</t>

The amateur gambling champion was fleeced for a cool 15 million credits when the mining corporation she had invested in folded leaving several backers without a credit chip to show for it. Trantaeos claims she was approached by a character called Max Enron who spoke of developing silicon seams in Скриня Скарбів sector. However, our sources say the gullible gambler was duped by the old tale of nividium under the rocks.\n\nTrantaeos has asked the Profit Guild to step in but they are known to be unsympathetic when a Теладі foolishly loses every credit in some scheme that goes bankrupt. Even were they to be interested, the Аргон authorities in Скриня Скарбів say they have no record of  &quot;Max Enron&quot; and report that the New TC Mining Group was registered using, irony of ironies, a numbered account at the Profit Guild Bank in Сейзвел.

The Теладі pilot, Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, used a jumpdrive fitted to her modified Boron Octopus to skip 4 sectors on the course. The usual punishment for cheating during a race is for the offender to be released into a planetary atmosphere to burn to death. This punishment was avoided however, as 3 of the other race pilots tracked down the cheating Теладі and destroyed her ship, killing her instantly. In the absence of the original &quot;winner&quot;, the prize of 10,000 credits was awarded to the pilot who was the first to finish without cheating, a Паранід pilot named Sao't Sht. The bonus of 5,000 credits for beating the course record has been returned to the race organisers.\n\nIn related news, it would appear that gate race pilots are improving in skill. After a season of races where the average number of competitor deaths from collisions was 25, and the individual races never had less than 12, it is interesting to note that the last race only contained 4 deaths. This includes the death of Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, the cheating Теладі pilot. A good example of evolution at work.\n\nVal Gisler - Sports Correspondent, MIN[/justify][/text]</t>

The TS class vessel carrying the precious liquid was totally destroyed and a number of nearby vessels were damaged. The cargo-carrier had just backed off from a collision with another ship when it exploded in a vast fireball.

It was unbelievable, we never knew there was so much information available about it.&quot; Noah's final tour took the tourists to the holographic room, where they were shown the short holofilm that was found on an asteroid a long time ago in the old sector of Хмари Ронкар. The tourists were amazed and in a way sad at the way the earth was befallen by the chaos of war with the terraformers, and how they got the name of Аргон. Derived from Nathan R. Gunn, the captain of the fleet that tricked the terraformers to follow them through a secret gate which was later destroyed. The group was awed at the chase that lead the earth fleet through many sectors in this universe. Some were in tears at the way the earth fleet was gradually picked off one by one by the evil terraformers, now known as the Ксенон. The final crash by the remaining ship from the earth fleet and how they finally settled down on Аргон Prime.\n\nMany tourists had never heard of the earth test pilot that ended up stranded in the Теладі sector of Сейзвел, and how his ship had got here without the use of a jumpdrive. Kept secret for many jazuras by many governments, they learned how he had found the holographic data disk in the old sector of Хмари Ронкар, which the earth pilot had returned to the Goners, the final battle that took the races to final victory over the Ксенон, and how they kept the Ксенон in retreat to now form the current shape of the universe.\n\nNoah Gaffelt later said, &quot;I always love the final part of the tour, as the tourists watch in horror at the holographic movie, its a tragedy and in a way gives us many lessons to learn about the war which befell earth.

In an effort to conclude this argument and gain more knowledge of the tournament which our conservative brothers are calling 'a brutal excuse for the conflict of war without the political implications' and which continues to divide our brotherhood a Гонер Chiun Ta Cho master, Master Hwange was entered as an Аргон competitor.  As you all know the art Chiun Ta Cho is practiced among us to preserve the body and calm the spirit and has no direct connection with violence of any kind.  Nonetheless Master Hwange was able to defeat his first opponent the Паранід, Falix Halifalix by methodically avoiding his blows for 17 hours before Falix collapsed of exhaustion.  Master Hwange then forfeited his place in the competition by refusing to face fellow Аргон, Nathan Gunner. It is uncertain what experiences Master Hwange will share\nwith us when he returns but it is certain that while our brotherhood is divided over this issue we must remember that it is our only difference and that we may disagree here and remain united in other things, preserving our order, as we have done in less fortunate centuries than this one.\n\nJo Springer - Social And Culture Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

At present, there is of course no obligation to grow a beard as a Гонер, yet most choose to do so as it is traditional. Clean shaven Goners argue that they are being discriminated against - all the high council have beards and infact there has never been a clean shaven Гонер elected to this lofty position. The beard brigade dismiss this as nonsense, and have suggested that if the clean shaven Goners spent more time worshipping and studying instead of worrying about facial hair, then maybe they would in time become more worthy of a council position.

Marais was born an Аргон in the Туманність Херона sector and made a life for himself as a fighter pilot. He took part in many engagements and several of the border wars that have cursed our age. A chance encounter with one of our brothers, whose name is not known, changed the life of Brother Marais. He travelled to the Great Temple in Cloudbase Southwest and duly decided to follow the Гонер Way.\n\nIn the course of his life with us, Brother Marais became famous for his metaphysical jokes and perplexing questions. Famously he asked a Спліт warrior, visiting the Temple as part of the then Спліт Ambassador's entourage, &quot;How sharp is a sword with no blade?&quot; Much taken with this, the Спліт warrior went away. Several mazura later, that warrior, Kao 't Pst, became the first Спліт to follow the Гонер Way.\n\nBrother Marais had a great sense of humour and while he could publish such masterworks as Philosophical Investigations into the Hidden Universe, he could also produce the famed and much-loved No Joke Left Unturned, acknowledged by many professional comedians as a fund of material.

Donations for his remembrance will be gratefully received by the temple \(denominations of 10 credits only please\).

Whilst we are completely opposed to slavery, particularly of our own, it is interesting to note that this has resulted in more conversions to our faith. It seems that our captured missionaries have continued to preach the faith to their fellow slaves, who are converting in their droves. Rumour has it that the Спліт mine owners are concerned about this, but cannot stop the religion spreading as every time they try to suppress it, another martyr to the cause is born. It is extremely gratifying to know that the Гонер faith is helping so many slaves come to terms with their conditions now.

It was thought that this experiment would promote greater understanding and conversion within the Спліт race, plus Jes Ramussen was convinced that his faith would allow him to overcome the fearsome Ghok without the need for violence. Entering the arena in an almost trance-like state, the contest ultimately lasted just under one mizura, and then only that long as the Ghok appeared to have trouble swallowing Ramussen's clothing in addition to the rest of his body \(Гонер robes are quite prickly and itchy\).

They argue that the sale or purchase of Гонер ships should be made illegal, as they could only have been sourced by illegal means. Shipyard owners disagree, saying that this would stifle the free-market liberal trading economy that the races have worked so hard to establish, and would set a precedent that could lead to other products being banned as well. The debate was sparked after the High Council released the astonishing figures for last jazura, reporting a loss of 207 ships, and after new ship production, a net loss of 45 ships. This has prompted the High Council to demand that captured ships be returned to the Goners and their former owners prosecuted. The shipyard owners have adamantly refused this, in the interests of the confidentiality of their clients.\n\nMiria Gisler, Communications Correspondent, GCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

The mercenaries, who  had all knowledge of their employers chemically wiped out, were to use a matter transporter to deliver a primed Hornet class missile into the main concourse of the station. If such a weapon were to detonate in an unshielded area of that kind it would tear the facility apart.\n\nGoner Intelligence have long monitored the whereabouts of matter transmission devices and became concerned some mazura ago, when a transmat-equipped Теладі vessel was reported lost to a pirate attack. It now appears that agents of Гонер Intelligence were successfully able to trace the device and pass on the information to Аргон authorities.\n\nWhile the mercenaries have no memory of their employers, they were able to name a numbered account at the Теладі Profit Guild Bank in Гордість Компанії . Аргон agents found the account to be empty after obtaining a warrant from Guild authorities. The Теладі factor in the affair has been noted but seems nothing more than circumstantial at this time.

 <t id="8">[article][eval if_race='Спліт'/][/article][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]Спліт Ex-prison Chief to debate the Death Penalty[/title][text cols='2'][justify]After a long heated debate about how the death penalty should be given, it's been finally decided that the Спліт courts will offer this capital punishment less than what it was but &quot;there will still be terrible consequences for breaking the laws.&quot; Buyo remarked.\n\nWe asked what are these terrible consequences only to get from him: &quot;This information will remain disclosed to people above a certain clearance level, but we can assure you, you wouldn't want to know.&quot;\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="9">[article][eval if_race='Спліт'/][/article][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]Спліт Ex-prison Chief to debate the Death Penalty[/title][text cols='2'][justify]A discussion about the death penalty for criminals and enemies of the Спліт will be taking place in a short while with hopes to make the death penalty a less used sentence then the 79% of times it's given out in cases held in past times. The ex-prison official, Temon Buyo, commented at the press conference prior to the holding of the meeting, that:\n\n&quot;It would be better to keep the sentence as it is. The Спліт aren't feared the way the Ксенон or Boron are... we must make sure that everyone knows that we aren't pushovers&quot;.\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="10">[article][eval if_race='Теладі'/][/article][author]{1294,50}[/author][title]Teladianium prices predicted to rise[/title][text cols='1' colwidth='500'][justify]According to the Metal Brokers, Thelisias Pontamonen Arakos, the price of Teladianium is predicted to rise. Demand has skyrocketed since the start of the troubles with the Хаак. It may be a short term effect with more Teladianium Mines coming on-line every Tazura. Aggenmenas Glutamus Fakatos, the chief Broker for the company said &quot;The market shows sign of a shortage that should correct itself in the medium to long term. We are recommending a buy at the moment&quot;.\n\nThe owner of the Brokers, Thelisias Pontamonen Arakos IV, owns more than half of all Teladianium mines and was unavailable for comment.\n\nYoyunis Towisaris Yooses IV - Foreign Affairs Correspondent CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]First impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are now negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. The most important changes will be made to the rules regarding the Jumpgate Exit Procedure, the placement of satellites and overtaking of slower spacecrafts. It is planned that so called &quot;gate sleepers&quot; are to be fined a high amount of credits. &quot;Gate sleepers&quot; who accelerate too slowly after having passed the gate have caused a lot of accidents in the past, especially in sectors with high traffic density. Still there is a controversial debate on whether to make the use of Boost-Drives mandatory for spacecrafts with low acceleration capability in order to enable them to leave the dangerous area fast enough.\n\nBut, as all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]More impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are still negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. We can now present some more details: There will be special areas for the communication satellites to place them into space. This is meant to be a measure against the &quot;wild&quot; placement of satellites as it is being practised nowadays. Satellites get destroyed too often causing increasing troubles for the indemnification insurance business. The Теладі delegation proposed to protect these satellite areas with SQUASH mines. While the Паранід have already agreed to this proposal and the Спліт are expected to follow, the Boron and Аргон are likely to offer some resistance because of their general ban on these weapons. They prefer lasertowers.\n\nBut, as already mentioned in another article, because all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="0">Tutorial: Basic Controls</t>
 <t id="5">(_Voice is a nice yet authoritarian military guide. Male_)Welcome to the Аргон federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom and I'm your guide in this level of the simulation. -- Since this is only a tutorial session to familiarize you with the controls, you are allowed to skip this simulation at any time by pressing the QUIT key or by selecting QUIT from the menus.</t>
 <t id="101">To access the ship computer please press the &quot;main-menu&quot;-key now.</t>
 <t id="103">0</t>
 <t id="110">0</t>
 <t id="111">It is time to try out the weapon systems of your ship. A few containers have been deployed around your ship. Do not shoot at them yet! Target one of the containers by using the &quot;target next/previous&quot;-keys. Only objects close to you can be targeted.</t>
 <t id="112">Well done! Now go ahead and destroy all containers.</t>
 <t id="113">Very good, all containers have been destroyed. A second batch of containers will now appear near you. Please destroy them this time with different laser. -- If you have more than one laser in your ship you can exchange it. To do so now, please open the weapon selection menu either directly or through the main menu.</t>
 <t id="114">Good. Now close the menu and destroy all containers with this new laser!</t>
 <t id="115">00</t>
 <t id="116">Your task is to pass through all Kessler rings which are still marked with a green light. Your target has been set to one of the rings to make it easy for you to find the first ring. Just follow the arrows.</t>
 <t id="120">Good work, the containers are destroyed. Your ship has an automated freight load-and-deploy system which you can use to salvage objects from space. In order to not interfere with operation of the ship shields, the shields are temporarily shut down while the system is active. -- To activate the system and open the loading bay you have to select the menu item &quot;open freight bay doors&quot; in your shipmenu. Then fly over the container to load it into your ship. Shortly after successfully catching the object, the loading system will deposit it in your ship's cargo hold.</t>
 <t id="121">0</t>
 <t id="122">Your task is to find and collect one of the containers. Fly over the container after you opened the cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="131">When you are very close to the other ship, you can select the &quot;enter ship&quot; item in the shipinfo-menu for the ship you are about to enter. - A personal tip: Look up the hotkeys for actions like opening an info menu or for directly entering or leaving a ship.</t>
 <t id="132">Oops, you entered your old ship again! Leave, and fly over to the other ship, please!</t>
 <t id="133">You are not close enough yet. </t>
 <t id="140">Congratulations pilot. You finished part 1 of the training simulation. </t>
 <t id="999">(_used for main menu_)You can select between tutorial and practicing sessions. Tutorials are optional to learn basic as well as advanced features of the game.  Practicing sessions however have to be finished successfully to activate further levels of the simulator.</t>
 <t id="1111">Target one of the containers by using the &quot;target next/previous&quot;-keys.</t>
 <t id="1132">Good. Now select the item &quot;your current ship&quot;.</t>
 <t id="1133">This is the ship menu for your ship. Please select the item &quot;weapons&quot; now.</t>
 <t id="1134">You now see an overview of your ships laser bays. You can now select a new laser. Please install the beta particle accelerator cannon in one of the bays.</t>
 <t id="11321">Please open up the main-menu now.</t>

 <t id="1">The central place from where you can reach every menu is the main-menu. You can enter it by pressing the &quot;main menu&quot;-key.</t>
 <t id="2">OK. After this short introduction to some important menus we will get to the real action now. Point the nose of your ship to the space-station and press the &quot;target&quot;-key to select the station as your target.</t>
 <t id="4">Good work. You now own two upgrades which we are going to try out now. Please leave the station.</t>
 <t id="5">Well done. Now fly into a landing platform to bring up the stations menu.</t>
 <t id="6">Your target has been set to an M5-class ship. Don't be afraid, it is completely defenceless and waits to be destroyed by a mosquito-missile. By pressing the &quot;select missile&quot;-key you can cycle through the missiles available. -- Alternatively you can select a missile from the &quot;weapons&quot;-menu of your ship. -- Now select the mosquito missile, fly to the ship, keep it targeted and press the &quot;launch missile&quot;-key.</t>
 <t id="7">Transporter successfully destroyed. Congratulation pilot - You have finished the part 2 of the training simulation. </t>
 <t id="10">You see the information has been sorted in &quot;Player&quot;, &quot;Navigation&quot; and &quot;Target&quot; pages. Select &quot;Message Log&quot; from the &quot;Player&quot;-page.</t>
 <t id="11">This is the &quot;Ship-Menu&quot;. Using &quot;scroll up/down&quot; keys you can scroll through the passive information part at the top. -- Selecting items in the lower active part of the menu is done with &quot;menu selection Up/Down&quot; keys. -- Please select the item &quot;ship details&quot; now and confirm with &quot;select&quot;.</t>
 <t id="12">You can now see detailed information about your current ship. You can open this same menu for other, even for enemy ships as well. To scroll use the &quot;scroll up/down&quot; keys. Now press the &quot;back&quot; key to go back to the &quot;ship-menu&quot; and from there select the &quot;command console&quot; menu.</t>
 <t id="13">This is the &quot;Command-Console&quot; of your shipcomputer. Here you can program your shipcomputer or that of other ships you own but which you are not sitting in yourself. Please press the &quot;back&quot; key and select the &quot;freight bay&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="14">You are now in the &quot;weapons-menu&quot;. From here you can install available lasers into your main cockpit and - in case you sit in a bigger ship - into the ships turrets. Also missiles can be installed. Please press the &quot;back&quot; key and then select the &quot;freight bay&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="16">Here you can see information about your titles and rankings, your statistics and log entries. Use &quot;scroll up/down&quot; keys to scroll. Please press the &quot;back&quot; key now and then go to the &quot;Navigation&quot; tab and select the &quot;universe-map&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="17">The &quot;Universe Map&quot; shows all sectors you already have visited. Not every sector is linked to all of its neighbours! Please press the &quot;back&quot; key and select the &quot;sector map&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="18">This perhaps is the most important source of information. It bears ALL information for objects present in a system which are in range of your scanners plus some static information about stationary objects that you have visited before. -- Moveable objects, like ships, disappear once they are outside the range of your scanners. -- You can zoom in and out with the &quot;zoom in/out&quot; keys. The &quot;switch&quot; key switches between top and side view. -- Additionally objects can be filtered by selecting the &quot;Stations&quot; or &quot;Ships&quot; tab. You can use this map for easier navigation in space by targeting an object first from the map and then flying towards the marked arrows. Now close all menus.</t>
 <t id="22">Within your scanner range you can see the object identified as &quot;Теладі Trading Station&quot; which has two yellow arrows next to it, this is the station you have targeted. You can upgrade the range of your scanners at some Equipment Docks by the way. Please close all menus again now.</t>
 <t id="23">OK. Now let's dock at the Trading Station! To do this you need to request permission to land. Open the COMM menu either directly using the COMM key or through the menu system. </t>
 <t id="24">Select &quot;request permission to land&quot;.</t>
 <t id="31">You see the menu of a station. From here you can see what ships are owned by this station, which are landed and with &quot;station details&quot; you get an overview of the goods the station deals with. But what we want to do now is trade with the station to buy some upgrades. So - select the &quot;trade with station&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="32">Now buy the &quot;docking computer&quot; and the &quot;best buys locator&quot; from this station. To do this, move the bar to the appropriate item and use the &quot;menuselection left/right&quot; keys to select the amount you want to buy or sell. In our case you want to buy one unit of each. Confirm your selection with the &quot;select&quot; key.</t>
 <t id="41">It's time to check out the destructive power of some different missiles. But first you'll have to buy them. Using the Best Buys locator, you can now find out where to buy an item as cheap as possible. -- When you open up the ship menu for your ship you can find an additional menu item named &quot;Best Buys Locator&quot;. Choose it to activate this upgrade.</t>
 <t id="42">You see that there is one station offering  the lowest prices for all three missiles we want to use. Dock there! This time you can spare the docking procedure because you already own a &quot;docking computer&quot; upgrade. --  Fly towards the cheapest station and from a distance of about 3.5km a new menu item called &quot;docking computer&quot; appears in the &quot;Target&quot;-tab of the main-menu. Use it or learn the correct hotkey, to dock automatically and safely in the station. </t>
 <t id="50">0</t>
 <t id="51">Select &quot;trade with station&quot; and buy one missile of each kind.</t>
 <t id="52">Good. Now start from the station.</t>
 <t id="62">Your last target is a small transporter. Its actual shield and hull strength are far below the destruction power of the silkworm missile. Try destroying it as well.</t>
 <t id="72">You are not supposed to buy missiles right now. The deal was rolled back.</t>
 <t id="110">This menu stores all messages you receive during flight. In this and the following simulations you can use it to review the instructions. Press the &quot;back&quot;-key and choose the item &quot;your current ship&quot;.</t>
 <t id="152">OK. The plankton has been ejected. This way you can also lay out mines or satellites. Satellites can help to remote control your ships or even your own station in distant sectors. They have wide range scanners and deliver this information to your shipboard computer navigation map. Please press the &quot;back&quot; key and then select the &quot;Your Personal Information&quot;-item.</t>
 <t id="231">Once you targeted an object, you can obtain detailed information about it via this menu. Also, you can communicate with it with the &quot;communication&quot; item. Select this item now.</t>
 <t id="601">What a pity you did not hit the ship. You will be given another mosquito missile. Please try again.</t>
 <t id="602">Of course the missile you selected would be strong enough to destroy the ship, but for this simulation please use the mosquito-missile for this ship.</t>
 <t id="611">Missed! Dragonfly missile reloaded. Please try again.</t>
 <t id="612">The silkworm missile surely is powerful enough to destroy the ship, but for this simulation please use the dragonfly missile to destroy the targeted ship.</t>
 <t id="621">Bad luck! Reequipped with a silkworm you should try again...</t>

 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Аргон federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom and in this simulation I will introduce you to different possibilities of setting up views on your HUD.  (_a little enthusiastically_)At the end of this session you will learn how to build your own factory.</t>
 <t id="1">By pressing the &quot;next cockpit&quot;-key you can cycle through the different cockpits of your ship. Every ship has at least one main-cockpit and - depending on the ship class and size - one or more turrets. The ship you currently sit in - the Аргон Nova - has two cockpits. To go to the other cockpit, press the &quot;next cockpit&quot;-key now.</t>
 <t id="2">I will now introduce you to the monitor system. A great invention to make handling of ship groups easier. Switch on the monitors in the options-menu or by pressing the &quot;toggle monitors&quot; hotkey.</t>
 <t id="3">Currently both monitors are disconnected. One way of attaching a view to a monitor is via the ship-menu. Open up the ship-menu for your ship.</t>
 <t id="4">Below the headline &quot;Monitor mapping&quot; you see some menu items which can be attached to a monitor. Now first select the item &quot;Cockpit: Back&quot;, then select &quot;Monitor 1&quot; and confirm the selection.</t>
 <t id="7">You now see the ship's main cockpit in the monitor-view. Try to accelerate and steer the ship.</t>
 <t id="8">There also is a camera view. Activate it by going to the shipmenu, and setting &quot;external view&quot; to monitor 2.</t>
 <t id="9">You now see your own ship from the outside in monitor 2. Activate monitor 2 and try to move the camera with the &quot;cameracontrol&quot; keys. Additionally you can zoom in/out with the &quot;camerazoom&quot;-keys. -- All of this is possible in all modes. So you can even set your large main view to an outside view of your ship and press the camera mode button to let it circle around in cinematic mode while you control your ship from one of the small monitors.</t>
 <t id="10">Now switch back to the main-view with the &quot;next monitor&quot;-key and from there return to the main-cockpit view with the &quot;next cockpit&quot;-key.</t>
 <t id="11">0</t>
 <t id="18">You can see that some enemy ships appear in front of your ship. The ships are unarmed and have poor shields. Target them, engage them and destroy them with your lasers!</t>
 <t id="19">Very good. Now there are some ships behind you. Switch to the backturret and shoot at the ships.</t>
 <t id="20">Good work. You should now be able to figure out how to setup monitors in a way that is useful for you. Now let's build a factory. Factories are sold at shipyards. Of course they are too big for your ship to carry, so you must hire a bigger ship that transports the station for you. Recently an Аргон Mammoth jumped into the sector near your location. Point your ship's nose towards the large transporter. Target it by pressing the &quot;target&quot;-key.</t>
 <t id="21">The first thing to do is to hire this TL-class ship. Open up the communication-menu for the TL. You want to talk to the Captain aboard this ship.</t>
 <t id="22">When talking to him, choose &quot;want you to transport something&quot; and agree to the offer.</t>
 <t id="23">OK. You have hired the TL. Next it must be told to dock at the shipyard. Open up the comm-menu once more and talk to the captain.</t>
 <t id="24">Now choose the item &quot;please move to shipyard...&quot; and in the following menus select the current sector and the &quot;Federal Аргон Shipyard&quot; inside of it.</t>
 <t id="25">Well done. While the TL docks at the shipyard, please dock there as well. Fly towards the shipyard, make it the current target and - when you are about 4km away - request to land.</t>
 <t id="26">Please wait until the TL has docked outside this station, too. To observe the TL you could set its external view of it to a monitor...</t>
 <t id="28">Good. Select trade with station now.</t>
 <t id="29">You see that the station sells only one solar power plant. Buy it!</t>
 <t id="30">Now you are asked where to load the factory. Of course that's why we have hired the TL. Choose Аргон Mammoth.</t>
 <t id="31">OK. The TL now has the station on board. Close all menus and leave the station.</t>
 <t id="32">Next, please target the hired TL.</t>
 <t id="33">Now you have to search a good place for the station. In real space you would have to find out, where such a worthwhile place is but for now it's good enough to build it anywhere in the sector. -- Therefore command the TL to follow you and then lead the Transporter a little bit away from the shipyard.</t>
 <t id="34">Good. Now it is time to let the Transporter drop his freight. Keep in mind that you have to be close to the TL for this command to be displayed. You will then be shown a &quot;Sector Map&quot; where you can select the final position of your station. -- Use the &quot;Camera-Control&quot;-keys to move the co-ordinates and use the Sector Map controls to zoom.</t>
 <t id="35">OK. You can watch your station build up automatically.</t>
 <t id="36">Congratulations. You have successfully completed this simulation.</t>
 <t id="252">The Аргон Mammoth has the wrong command. Please open the comm-menu again and tell the captain to dock at the shipyard.</t>

 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Аргон federation space academy simulator. --My name is Uri Seldom and in this simulation I will finally introduce you to the most advanced techniques of trading and running a business. --You are about to learn not just how to run your own cooperation, but even advanced tricks and tips how to use a whole fleet of ships to manage an empire effectively. --If you are not interested in such advanced management skills yet or plan a different career you can skip this simulation session at any time.</t>
 <t id="1">Transporter 1 of Cahoona</t>
 <t id="2">Transporter 2 of Cahoona</t>
 <t id="3">Transporter 1 of Forge</t>
 <t id="4">Transporter 2 of Forge</t>
 <t id="10">Please assign a command to ship &quot;Transporter 1 of Cahoona&quot;  to automatically bring Argnu Beef to your factory. One possibility to do this is to go to the appropriate menu - is to select the Cahoona Bakery and then access the list of &quot;landed Ships&quot;. -- Now choose &quot;Transporter 1 of Cahoona&quot; and select command console. Command the ship to &quot;Buy ware for best price...&quot; from the TRADE commands. -- This means that the ship will continue to buy resources for the station from another station. As resource to buy, please select &quot;Argnu Beef&quot;.</t>
 <t id="20">Well done pilot! Transporter 1 knows now what to do. If you want to give &quot;Transporter 2 of Cahoona&quot; the command to buy Energy Cells the same way, you will notice that this command is not available yet. -- The reason is that this ship has no homebase yet. -- To set the homebase, go to the command console of &quot;Transporter 2 of Cahoona&quot; and set the homebase to &quot;Cahoona Bakery&quot;.</t>
 <t id="30">OK, the ship is ready to get the resource for its homebase. Make &quot;Transporter 2 of Cahoona&quot; get Energy Cells like before.</t>
 <t id="40">OK, parameter set correct. The next step is to get the required resources for the Forge. It needs Energy Cells, Ore and Cahoona Meatsteaks. We will get the Meatsteaks from our own station once it has produced enough. -- Now we will get the Energy Cells manually. To do that first give &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; the command to &quot;Dock at...&quot; the Solar Power Plant. -- Another, shorter way to go to the command console of a ship is to use the &quot;Owned Properties&quot;-menu to directly choose the right transporter.</t>
 <t id="70">It would be a good idea to use this transporter also to get the Cahoona Meatsteaks from your Bakery. Commmand &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; to dock at the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="82">Good, please wait until it has landed there. To shorten the waiting time you could activate the Singularity Engine Time Accelerator.</t>
 <t id="90">The Bakery has now produced enough Meatsteak Cahoonas! Load at least 100 Meatsteaks into your transporter via the menu item &quot;Adjust station parameters&quot;.</t>
 <t id="100">Very well done! You already have passed the hardest part of the steps to successfully complete this simulation! -- The next thing to do is to bring the resources loaded in &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; to the forge. Command the transporter to &quot;Return home&quot;, to make it fly to your Forge.</t>
 <t id="102">OK. The transporter is on its way. Please wait until it has landed - Once the transporter is landed, you can manually unload the resources to the Forge and the production of the laser can begin.</t>
 <t id="111">&quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has just landed. Please transfer the Energy Cells and the Meatsteak Cahoonas to the forge. As explained earlier, you can do this via &quot;Adjust station parameters&quot; from the ship-menu.</t>
 <t id="112">Good work! The forge is going to produce the urgently needed EPT weapon - the enemy ships are closing on to this sector! The production time for a laser of this class has been slashed in this simulation.</t>
 <t id="113">The time is over! The second laser has been produced. Install the lasers quickly into your ship! To do that you have to land in the station and then transfer them to your current ship. You only have three minutes left before the enemies arrive!</t>
 <t id="114">Enemies are attacking! Defend your station NOW</t>
 <t id="115">Congratulations! You have successfully completed this simulation - A new level of simulations is now activated - Good luck!</t>
 <t id="1010">Please care for the right transporter.</t>
 <t id="1020">The ship has the wrong command. Please command the ship to &quot;Buy ware for best price...&quot; and then choose &quot;Argnu beef&quot;.</t>
 <t id="2010">Oops, you have mistaken the advice - please set the homebase to Cahoona Bakery!</t>
 <t id="2020"> Please set the homebase to Cahoona Bakery first.</t>
 <t id="3010">You have given a wrong command. Command the ship to &quot;Buy ware for best price...&quot; and then choose Energy Cells.</t>
 <t id="3020">The homebase has been reset to Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="3110">If you take a look at the landed ships, you will notice that the two transporters are still on board the Cahoona Bakery. The ships can trade only if the station has enough money. --  Give 10000 credits to the station and set the buying prices for the needed resources to their maximum. -- Do this via the &quot;Adjust station parameters&quot; item in the station-menu.</t>
 <t id="3120">Please move 10000 Credits of your money towards your station. By setting the parameter credits to 10000. Set Energy Cells and Argnu beef buying price to maximum!</t>
 <t id="3220">Please set credits of the Forge to 35000 and the buying price of Ore to maximum first!</t>
 <t id="4010">You are about to give a wrong command to the ship or sending it to the wrong station! Please command the ship to &quot;Dock at...&quot; the Solar Power Plant.</t>
 <t id="4020">The homebase has been reset to H.E.P.T Laser Forge.</t>
 <t id="5010">The transporter has a wrong command! Command it to &quot;Buy ware...&quot; Ore and then choose &quot;Ore Mine Alpha&quot;.</t>
 <t id="6020">You have bought too much, therefore the transaction is being partly rolled back. It would be clever to use this transporter also to get the Cahoona Meatsteaks from your Bakery. Commmand &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; to &quot;Dock at...&quot; the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="7010">The transporter has the wrong command. Tell it to &quot;Dock at...&quot; the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="7210">&quot;Transporter 2 of Forge&quot; has loaded the Ore, needed by the Forge.</t>
 <t id="7220">&quot;Transporter 2 of Forge&quot; has brought the Ore to the Forge.</t>
 <t id="7230">Your Cahoona Bakery has the needed resources and begins producing the Meatsteaks now.</t>
 <t id="8310">Please wait until the Cahoona Bakery has produced an amount of 100 Meatsteaks.</t>
 <t id="9010">You have unloaded Energy Cells, that were determined for the Forge. This transaction has been rolled back.</t>
 <t id="9020">Load 100 meatsteaks in &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot;.</t>
 <t id="10010">The transporter has a wrong command! Command it to &quot;Return home&quot;, making it fly to your forge.</t>
 <t id="100000">In this sector we already have a small business cycle. You own two stations:</t>
 <t id="100001">a Cahoona Bakery, producing Cahoona Meatsteaks,</t>
 <t id="100002">and an H.E.P.T Laser Forge, which needs Cahoona Meatsteks as well as other good to manufacture a large laser.</t>
 <t id="100003">Your task is to produce one urgently needed - Alpha H.E. Plasma Thrower - short &quot;EPT&quot;.</t>
 <t id="100004">First supply your Cahoona Bakery with the needed resources.</t>
 <t id="100005">Therefore bring Argnu Beef from the Argnu Ranch,</t>
 <t id="100006">and Energycells from the Solar Power Plant to the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="100007">Your Cahoona Bakery already has two transporter-ships supposed to get one resource each.</t>

<page id="300115" title="Senator McCarthy" descr="0" voice="yes">
 <t id="300051">We must rebuild, (Cut to shots of a dockyard at work) we must make Аргон strong once more. My fellow senators and I are drawing up emergency plans and we call upon all our citizens to be ready for the war we fight. A war unlike anything we have faced before. We must be vigilant. (Cut to pictures of Аргон warships). We must heed the call to fight for justice and freedom. We must find and we must destroy the Хаак where ever they may be found. This is the day for justice. This is the day for freedom. This is our day!</t>
 <t id="352302">My fellow senators. Today we are a planet awakened to danger. And while we have been touched by tragedy, the fires that brought it have only made the spirit of all our citizens burn more brightly. And in this light we see our course. We will not be broken. We will not surrender. We will prevail. Applause, cheering.</t>
 <t id="352304">They don't talk, they don't listen. They aren't interested in dialogue. They are only interested in death. Death in the thousands. And it isn't just Аргон that is a victim. Innocent Паранід, Спліт, Boron and Теладі, are our allies in suffering (Pictures of alien suffering). And I speak to them as much as to the senate. Let us find the Хаак homeworld, let us find this house of evil and let us rid ourselves of our enemy (we end on a Хаак ship exploding).</t>
 <t id="700003">...and it's about time we realised that the only thing that will stop this is their total destruction. The Хаак aren't interested in peace. They attacked for no reason and now it is time for us to teach them their mistake.</t>
 <t id="700005">These are strong times. Let us send a message to the Хаак. Either we will see an end to this war, or we will see an end to them.</t>
 <t id="800419">It is a warning to us all to remain vigilant. There are still forces that seek to destroy us and our battle for security, our search for just salvation, our need as a people of the free must continue. There are those who seek to destroy us and we will defend ourselves against them.</t>

<page id="300119" title="Ban Danna" descr="" voice="yes">
 <t id="310208">The patrol will start near the North Gate in Home of Light. From there take the West gate to Red Light. Cross Red Light and use the South gate for Південно-Західна Хмарна База. Check for Хаак activity in these sectors and eliminate any Хаак ships you come across.</t>
 <t id="310209">The flight leader's got some combat experience, but the rest are rookies. Hopefully, you'll get there without incident, but stay sharp and try and keep those pilots alive. We're going to need them.</t>
 <t id="430101">You can join the fleet by the Terracorp Nividium plant in Home of Light. The fleet is made of mixed ships so be careful, they could spread out due to their different speeds - particularly if you hit trouble. Pass on my regards to the fleet captain when you reach them.</t>
 <t id="730706">Julian, I've had to use secure channels to send you this message. The senate have now declared you renegade, so you'll have to stay out of sight of Аргон and Паранід installations. Both governments are talking to the other races and it won't be long before at least the Boron also declare you renegade. The only way out of this is for you to find out what the Паранід are doing and why.</t>
 <t id="730707">Hopefully, by now you've met up with the Don. He'll help you get what you need.  I think your instincts about a cloaking device are correct. It's not something we've been able to achieve, but there have been rumours of the Паранід succeeding. We'd been wondering how they managed it and you're right, the probability is that it was with help from this alien 'Sargon'. The question is - why Sargon suddenly chose to stop working with the Паранід and go to Ion instead.</t>
 <t id="730708">However they built the cloaking device, it will have been expensive and it will require huge amounts of energy to maintain, so whatever they are doing it must be worth a lot to them.</t>
 <t id="730709">By the way, the senate has also insisted that we return the Seed. The Паранід are sending a convoy to pick it up from us.</t>
 <t id="730710">Find out what they're doing, Julian and come back when you can prove it. Good luck!</t>

 <t id="300050">Hello and welcome to this special edition of Аргон Today. In this programme we look at the Хаак war and ask the question - Why?</t>
 <t id="300052">Here in this vid we witness the first of the Хаак's ruthless assaults on our civilisation(cut to existing footage without the V.O.), the attack at President's End. And, whilst there has been no major attack on Аргон settlements since the battle at Омікрон Ліри, the Хаак continue to destroy ships and installations, to murder innocent civilians. But, as Аргон forces seem unable to find a Хаак homeworld or even to communicate with this merciless enemy, we are left with few answers and fewer options for retaliation.</t>
 <t id="300053">The only person to have a close encounter with the Хаак is Kyle Brennan who was lost to them whilst searching for the AP Gunner and a way back to Earth(bring up a picture of Kyle set against footage of the ship). - Hero of the Ксенон war, Kyle remains in intensive care, unresponsive, as much a mystery as the Хаак who left him this way. Kyle's son Julian Brennan(Use a picture of him and some of the opening from X2) previously known as Julian Gardna, a notorious pirate, was one of those who helped defend Аргон in the crucial battle at Омікрон Ліри. Since then there has been a relative calm, but with Аргон forces at an all time low it can only be a matter of time before the Хаак return. Will we be ready to defend ourselves? What do the Хаак want? Someone who thinks they know the answer is Senator McCarthy.</t>
 <t id="352301">Hello and welcome to Аргон Today coming up ... Boron spas, the latest in relaxation innovation(picture of a happy Boron in a walk-in bath?). A pirate's life for me, we talk to a Yaki pirate and ask them, why(A picture of a Yaki/pirate attack)? But now on Аргон Today, we take a spotlight look at Senator Joana McCarthy.</t>
 <t id="352303">Senator Joana McCarthy speaking only hours after the Хаак attack on President's End. While there are those who are still seeking ways to open negotiations with the Хаак, Senator McCarthy is a leading hawk who thinks the only solution is the complete eradication of the Хаак race.</t>
 <t id="441201">Moving to news outside Аргон, the Паранід Empire suffered its heaviest attack to date with huge loses to all ships and stations in the Край Імперії sector. The Паранід minister for unholy affairs(drop in a photograph of the minister) has stated that their priests fear it is the taint of the unholy two eyes that has brought the wrath of the Хаак on their empire. To counter this fear, (Cut to pictures of the Паранід military Vessels taking up position by gates)all central Паранід sectors are being declared off limits to non-Paranids. All non-Паранід owned material in these sectors is being seized by the authorities.</t>
 <t id="441202">Аргон diplomatic sources are yet to officially respond to this, but advise all Аргон citizens to leave these sectors immediately. (Back to the studio)Sources close to the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia(add a picture of the Pontifex, or at least an artist's impression labelled as such) claim that any non-Paranids failing to comply with the order to leave will be destroyed. And now, the weather...</t>
 <t id="700002">Words from the frontline, which today reached Аргон Prime itself with the Хаак launching a devastating attack on our central sector. And with fires still burning across Argonia and several outlying cities, we go live to the Senate building for a statement by Senator McCarthy...</t>
 <t id="731201">...and following the dramatic escape(some shots of the player's prison ship escaping and a disruptor missile knocking out a patrol ship) of three prisoners including both Julian and Kyle Brennan, the Паранід Empire has accused the Аргон senate of colluding in the get away. The Paranids are now threatening to take military action.</t>
 <t id="731202">In a counterclaim, Аргон sources have stated that the Паранід empire is withholding information vital to the fight against the Хаак. As the diplomatic words heat and Паранід forces build on the border(we see Паранід ships gathering) it appears that Аргон could soon be fighting a war on two fronts.</t>
 <t id="800418">And with the disappearance of Хаак forces across all systems, we are all able to take a breath and be thankful that peace has returned, for the moment anyway.</t>
 <t id="800420">Next week, Earth - legend, religion, now fact. We ask are they friend, or are they foe? As the Terrans continue their silence and the Паранід draw new treaties with us, will we find we have more in common with our Паранід neighbours, than with our Terran brothers? This is Salik Harith. This is Аргон Today.</t>

 <t id="310101">Julian, thanks for coming. I've got a squadron fresh out of flight school due on their first combat patrol. I'd like you to show them a few tricks.</t>
 <t id="310103">The fleet's down to 30% ...and we don't have many old pilots left to teach the new ones. Can you think of a more important task? You'll get chance to put your life on the line soon enough. I just hope your father recovers soon to give us some insight into the Хаак. Have you been to see him?</t>
 <t id="310107">Julian...</t>
 <t id="310109">I'll hold you to that. Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="430001">Julian, I heard what happened with the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="430003">What do you need?</t>
 <t id="430005">I'm afraid Аргон Prime's not keen on loaning out equipment at the moment, but there's a Terracorp Nividium convoy in Home of Light that needs an escort. You help out with that and it should help me get you some spydrones. I'll be in touch.</t>
 <t id="431501">Julian, I've traced some spydrones, but I won't be able to get them released until you've helped out with that Terracorp convoy.</t>
 <t id="431502">I'm sorry, Julian, but I can't release those spy drones until you've helped out with a Terracorp convoy. There's another one gathering by the Nividium plant that needs an escort.</t>
 <t id="431503">Julian, I've traced some spydrones, but I won't be able to get them released until you've helped out with a Terracorp convoy. There's another one gathering by the Nividium plant. They'll be ready to go in a few hours.</t>
 <t id="431506">They'll be ready to go in an hour.</t>
 <t id="540002">Julian, could you meet me onboard, Аргон One? I've heard you might have plans of those Yaki missiles and I'd like to see them.</t>
 <t id="540102">Julian, please could you meet me on board, Аргон One.</t>
 <t id="540201">Welcome. I'm afraid Miss Marani will have to stay on her ship. If she was to be seen onboard...</t>
 <t id="540203">(Ignoring her)Those plans you recovered are going to come in very useful, Julian. We'll analyse them and I'll let you know when we have some answers. In the meantime, why don't you visit your father?</t>
 <t id="540206">Good, come aboard and I'll have someone escort you down.</t>
 <t id="710001">Julian, I have news of your father. He regained consciousness during the Хаак attack on Аргон Prime, but before I could speak to him he stole a ship and left the station. His doctors have evidence that at the moment the Хаак arrived, his brainwaves matched the pattern of the Хаак jump events. I'm afraid word of this has got back to the senate. Senator McCarthy thinks he is being influenced by the Хаак and has ordered that Kyle must be found and, if he refuses to return, the search party has permission to fire on him.</t>
 <t id="710002">I can't delay the search fleet forever, but I can give you a headstart. Before he went, your father looked up files on the AP Gunner. As you know he was looking for the Gunner before he disappeared, so I believe he's headed where you found it in Схованка Ньяни. We have to know what's important about that ship and what he discovered about the Хаак.</t>
 <t id="710003">Find him and bring him home safe, Julian. I can't believe your father would betray us.</t>
 <t id="720204">If there is a link, and I have to say 'if' right now, Kyle, then that would explain why the Хаак have hit the Паранід so hard.</t>
 <t id="720207">I think it's time we found out.</t>
 <t id="720209">I'm sorry, Kyle, this is one for Julian. (To Julian) You have a pass that gives you access to the Паранід central sectors?</t>
 <t id="720211">Then I think you should do a little reconnaissance. I'll have a ship prepared. Take care of any business you have and return to Аргон One, we'll have it ready for you.</t>
 <t id="720230">Ah, Julian. The ship is ready. Good Luck, we're counting on you. Though I'm sure Saya will keep an eye on you.</t>
 <t id="720231">Julian. The ship is ready. Please return to Аргон One.</t>
 <t id="720233">Good to see you're eager. It will take us another few minutes to install the equipment. I'll contact you as soon as it's done.</t>
 <t id="720234">Ah, Julian. The ship is ready.</t>
 <t id="720235">Good Luck, we're counting on you.(Then into 720212)</t>
 <t id="720501">Hello, Julian. I'm afraid you need to scan those installations, we'll need proof if you are to go to the Аргон senate and the sooner you get it done it, the sooner we start saving lives. Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="720601">That's a start, Julian. It looks like your father was right, but we'll need more proof. Go back with Saya and scan the rest of those installations then we can start putting this right.</t>
 <t id="722802">Julian, please return to Аргон One immediately. There have been some developments.</t>
 <t id="722902">Julian, please return to Аргон One immediately. The Паранід Empire has declared you a criminal for the murder of Armanckessilon and for the theft of the Seed. It looks like Аргон will also agree to declare you a criminal. You need to return here as soon as possible so we can sort this out.</t>
 <t id="723002">Julian, the Аргон Senate has voted to declare you a criminal. Your assets have been frozen and if you do not return immediately, then steps will be taken to bring you to justice. You must return as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="730005">Julian. I'm sorry about this.</t>
 <t id="730007">She's fine. Julian, have you heard of a Паранід called Armanckessilon?</t>
 <t id="730009">His family claims you murdered him and a Паранід called Nolmancketnun has alleged that you stole the Seed.</t>
 <t id="730011">A well known pirate isn't going to help your case, especially as the Паранід are threatening to declare war. They say we've let them take the worst of the Хаак attacks and are already negotiating with the Спліт. With our fleet spread so thin...I'm afraid the senate has decided to hand you over to them.</t>
 <t id="730013">Senator McCarthy pushed through a senate decree two hours ago. You, Ion and your father are to be transferred to Аргон before being sent to Паранід Прайм. As a pledge of honour you're being allowed to fly yourself. I urge you NOT to escape, Julian. (Hint) If you were to escape and find evidence of what's been happening then you would be on your own. And if you ran to the Don Marani, well that might confirm your guilt, no matter how helpful it might be.</t>
 <t id="730101">Julian, if you deviate any further from your flight plan then security vessels will be sent to stop you. This is your last warning.</t>
 <t id="800101">This is Аргон One to all Паранід ships. Cease all hostile actions immediately.</t>
 <t id="800103">Massive power readings from normally calm space? You're an incredibly easy person to find. Where's Kyle?</t>
 <t id="800106">Now, I should arrest you, but right now, I think I'd rather offer you parole and a chance to help out.</t>
 <t id="800111">I've put out a call, but Хаак are attacking several systems, the fleet can't spare any more ships</t>
 <t id="800112">We've got to hold the line.</t>
 <t id="800119">We're losing too many ships!</t>
 <t id="800121">Julian, that M2 needs help!</t>
 <t id="800124">Хаак M0 coming in!</t>
 <t id="800125">Julian can you get over there and man their turrets until they get their shields back?</t>
 <t id="800142">There's another wave of suicide ships heading towards you! I'm transferring you to a fighter to intercept!</t>
 <t id="800150">Julian, Redoubt's weapons are offline, can you cover her while they make repairs?</t>
 <t id="800153">This order is direct from the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia and the senate council. You are hereby placed under my command. Any Паранід ships disobeying this are to be destroyed, at the Pontifex's pleasure. End of general transmission. (Some sort of visual clue to the switch) Julian.</t>
 <t id="800154">All ships, engage the Хаак fleet.</t>
 <t id="800166">Аргон One requesting covering fighters.</t>
 <t id="800201">You leave now, Julian and there's no way the senate will forgive you.</t>
 <t id="800402">Great maker! All forces pull back.</t>
 <t id="800404">We haven't the ships. We must gather the fleet to protect Аргон.</t>
 <t id="800409">Kyle, good to hear from you old friend.</t>
 <t id="800412">Earthfleet, please accept our thanks. I speak here on behalf of all...</t>
 <t id="800430">All ships, set course for Аргон immediately...</t>
 <t id="800431">Come in Renown...(Static) Come in Illustrious...(Static)</t>
 <t id="800433">We might not have the forces to defend ourselves. All ships, return to Аргон immediately.</t>
 <t id="800436">All ships - engage until destroyed.</t>
 <t id="800438">And may the maker be with you.</t>
 <t id="811004">Ah, Julian, yes, I might have just the thing, I'm transmitting details.</t>
 <t id="811005">Credits? Yes, I have something you can do...sending now.</t>
 <t id="811006">If you have the time, I do have a mission for you.</t>
 <t id="811007">Ah, Julian, yes, I have a mission for you. I'll send you the details.</t>
 <t id="811008">Certainly, check your messages for a briefing.</t>
 <t id="811009">I'm afraid you'll have to finish the mission I gave you first. I'm resending details.</t>
 <t id="811010">I've given you a mission already, finish that and we can talk. Resending details.</t>
 <t id="811011">Finish the one I gave you and we'll talk.</t>
 <t id="811012">I'm sorry I don't have any more information. Good luck.</t>
 <t id="811013">You'll have to find things out yourself, Julian, Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="811014">We don't know anything else I'm afraid, you'll have to find out.</t>

 <t id="350019">Let me guess, mass destruction and the end of the galaxy?</t>
 <t id="350021">Then let's see what he's got to say and find whoever stole the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350026">(The sound of Julian stirring.)</t>
 <t id="350302">Don Tony Marani, you are to return the White Crystal, or you will be destroyed.</t>
 <t id="350305">Not that damaged.</t>
 <t id="350313">Where did he go?</t>
 <t id="350337">This is for Dogun!</t>
 <t id="350339">Give us that crystal!</t>
 <t id="350345">You really think he's letting us have it?</t>
 <t id="350724">It wasn't a pirate ship.</t>
 <t id="350727">I've lost it.</t>
 <t id="350735">He's dropping something.</t>
 <t id="350747">Lower your shields and return the white crystal</t>
 <t id="350749">Don't think he likes your jokes.</t>
 <t id="350756">This is for Dogun!</t>
 <t id="350758">Careful, it might not be the crystal.</t>
 <t id="351602">One dangerous rock seeking a safe home.</t>
 <t id="351605">Do you believe in coincidences?</t>
 <t id="351607">I'd better warn Noah. I don't want that crystal going missing again.</t>
 <t id="410002">Hasn't Ion told you? I recovered it from the Don.</t>
 <t id="410006">Er, bad news, I just stole it for him. How bad is that? I mean, what do these stones do?</t>
 <t id="410008">Oh, yeah. I think Ion and I need a little chat.</t>
 <t id="410510">Do they play fair in these things? Or am I going to get thrusters in my face?</t>
 <t id="410512">Great.</t>
 <t id="410513">Okay, Noah, so who do we talk to?</t>
 <t id="410925">And the Rookie takes the lead.</t>
 <t id="410926">Now who's the Rookie? You, dimwad!</t>
 <t id="410927">Coming through!</t>
 <t id="410928">I thought you guys could race!</t>

 <t id="420111">Bet he's great at parties. Come on. Let's see what Ban's got in his box of tricks.</t>
 <t id="430002">(Rueful) Yeah. We've got a line on this Ion guy, but we're going to need some help if we're to reel him in.</t>
 <t id="430004">A way to listen in on a meeting, but without anyone knowing we're there.</t>

 <t id="430403">I see them! Transporting over</t>

 <t id="430502">Computer, hit the...</t>
 <t id="430702">Try and hold it together, we can...make it out of here</t>
 <t id="430902">Terracorp owes me a lot more than that.</t>
 <t id="431004">Haven't you got anything better to do?</t>
 <t id="431008">You do realise that Saya's coming the chances of this being a secret mission are about a thousand to one?</t>
 <t id="431504">Аргон escort to Terracorp fleet captain.</t>
 <t id="440002">Yeah, but I'm not planning on getting close, not without a defence against those disruptor missiles. Let's use that asteroid field for cover.</t>
 <t id="440004">Hide and wait.</t>
 <t id="440006">Here he is.</t>
 <t id="440402">Shields down. They've got missile lock.</t>
 <t id="440506">You trying to encourage me, or distract me, Saya?</t>
 <t id="440522">Looks like a drone.</t>
 <t id="440702">Bastu!</t>
 <t id="440704">Too late!</t>
 <t id="440803">All this for a light show?</t>
 <t id="440806">What is it?</t>
 <t id="441002">Okay, let's lose these guys.</t>
 <t id="441103">All that time my father spent searching, and now someone's found it.</t>
 <t id="450003">I'm not Yaki, you dimwad!</t>
 <t id="450010">You want to talk or fight? Cos I'm happy with just talking.</t>
 <t id="450011">You've got the wrong guy!</t>
 <t id="450014">I haven't touched your daughter!</t>
 <t id="450302">What little girl? Have you gone completely spacehappy?</t>
 <t id="450304">I'm not Yaki. okay? They tricked me into stealing the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="450306">Do you know anything about these missiles they use? The disruptors?</t>
 <t id="450308">Then you got a deal.</t>
 <t id="460302">I had a visit from the Don Marani. Apparently the Yaki have his daughter. We free her, he helps us get rid of the disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="460304">Last he heard, she was on the trading station.</t>
 <t id="460306">You get any time off, take some comedy lessons.</t>
 <t id="460702">The crumbs lead to this silicon mine, we should check it out.</t>
 <t id="460703">A whole heap of nada.</t>
 <t id="460902">I'm looking for Miria Marani.</t>
 <t id="460904">I'm here from the Don. You want me to call him? You think the Don wants to come down here?</t>
 <t id="460906">The Yaki?</t>
 <t id="460911">If we do we find her we can't attack the station. That'd put her at even more risk.</t>
 <t id="460913">I think we should offer the Yaki some bait.</t>
 <t id="460915">I think you'll make a wonderful slave girl.</t>
 <t id="461002">What do you want most out of life?</t>
 <t id="461004">That's because you've got your mother and Terracorp. When you've not got roots, it's easy for one thing to take over your life.</t>
 <t id="461006">Let's check out further East we're getting nothing here.</t>
 <t id="461008">You work for Terracorp, you found things quiet there?</t>
 <t id="461010">Let's try some silent running. I don't want the Yaki picking up any comms and running scared.</t>
 <t id="461012">You? Come on admit it, you can't wait to play hostages and Пірат.</t>
 <t id="461602">Mines, there they are! Sooner they ban these things the better.</t>
 <t id="461703">Er, a bit late with the undetected, Saya.</t>
 <t id="462101">These guys just don't know when to give up.</t>
 <t id="462201">Now that's going to take some redecorating.</t>
 <t id="462203">Oh, yeah! How about I knock on the door and ask nicely?</t>
 <t id="462205">Get into the station (We see Яма in the spacestation), right? At least the Yaki've left the backdoor open.</t>
 <t id="462208">Great start.</t>
 <t id="462209">One ship, one careful lady owner. Time to get onboard.</t>
 <t id="462210">Okay, Saya, I've picked up your ship in the docking bay, give me your co-ordinates and let's get out of here!</t>
 <t id="462212">The reactor's going to blow.</t>
 <t id="462215">I'm getting there.</t>
 <t id="462219">Traffic was terrible. Can you fly this?</t>
 <t id="462221">Then transport me back to my ship. I'll fly escort duty.</t>
 <t id="462226">I'm on my way!</t>
 <t id="462233">The good news.</t>
 <t id="462235">Great! What's the bad news?</t>
 <t id="462237">Is there any other way out?</t>
 <t id="462239">Great, turrets.</t>
 <t id="462240">And this suit was brand new.</t>
 <t id="462241">Got to get the timing right...</t>
 <t id="462905">Is she okay?</t>
 <t id="462927">Did you get Miria out?</t>
 <t id="463605">So...what do we do now? A whole group of slave girls wasn't in the plan.</t>
 <t id="463610">Er, yeah. Me too.</t>
 <t id="463802">It's me.</t>
 <t id="463804">I believe we had a deal.</t>
 <t id="500302">I had things to do. Did you bring the information?</t>
 <t id="500305">Did you bring the information?</t>
 <t id="500502">Let's pay the Паранід a visit.</t>
 <t id="500504">They've only shut the central sectors. Let's head to Імператорські Шахти and see what we can do after that.</t>
 <t id="500505">Let's visit the Ксенон. I've always wanted a look at that old M0.</t>
 <t id="500507">(Covering) What?</t>
 <t id="500509">Yeah, but yours didn't save the universe. Try following that.</t>
 <t id="500511">(Lightening) Well, everyone makes mistakes.</t>
 <t id="500514">Let's take a look at the Yaki. If we sort out those missiles it'll make things safer for us.</t>
 <t id="500516">What is it about girls and space? Does it do something to your brains?</t>
 <t id="500518">Yeah, that I don't want a picture of. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="500803">Let's get the Паранід Crystal.</t>
 <t id="500804">Let's take a shot at the Ксенон.</t>
 <t id="500805">Let's get those Yaki disruptor plans.</t>
 <t id="500810">Not yet.</t>
 <t id="510102">Yeah. Can you go over the details?</t>
 <t id="510106">No, I still want to get the Black crystal.</t>
 <t id="510107">No, let's sort those Yaki out.</t>
 <t id="510112">Glad you agree.</t>
 <t id="510155">Hmmm, you know, maybe we should go help Armanckessilon instead</t>
 <t id="510157">Let's go see.</t>
 <t id="510158">Hmmm, you know, maybe we should go help Armanckessilon.</t>
 <t id="510160">Yeah. Let's get the Паранід's crystal.</t>
 <t id="510303">We can't count on that and it doesn't help us get in.</t>
 <t id="510305">And in the land of the locked out, the two eyed Паранід is king. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="511308">I haven't got the money.</t>
 <t id="511311">Great lead, Miria, thanks.</t>
 <t id="511401">I'm transferring funds now.</t>
 <t id="511405">Then we'd better have some money ready for when he comes back.</t>
 <t id="511502">Er, you wouldn't consider say some trading station gift tokens or an I.O.U. instead? (Nolman's comm switches off). I guess that's a no.</t>
 <t id="512102">(cutting in at beloved) These guys have a script or what?</t>
 <t id="512104">Oh great and magnificent Armanckessilon. I seek an audience with you to purchase the Blue Sculpt if you can spare the time for this humble being.</t>
 <t id="512109">I've got 'em.</t>
 <t id="512111">I'm on them.</t>
 <t id="512201">Miria, that ship that just appeared. Keep an eye on it.</t>
 <t id="512203">That's what I want to find out.</t>
 <t id="512302">Why was it here? That thing's following me.</t>
 <t id="512304">It's more of a stalker ...</t>
 <t id="512502">Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="512504">You think we can control the Хаак now? They attacked us too!</t>
 <t id="512507">That ship, the one that disappeared, it must be after the crystal.</t>
 <t id="512508">Let's hope the crystal's in with the cargo.</t>
 <t id="512512">Too slow! Got it!</t>
 <t id="513002">The others they stole were part of a machine built by the ancients. You want to risk the Yaki getting hold of something like that?</t>
 <t id="513302">Head back to the Гонер Temple.</t>
 <t id="513304">They're the people who can put the pieces of this puzzle together. It was a rogue priest that stole the first two crystals with the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="513401">Where is your contact again?</t>
 <t id="513610">I've changed my mind. Let's get the Паранід Crystal.</t>
 <t id="513612">You always talk this much?</t>
 <t id="513620">Let's take a shot at the Ксенон Crystal instead.</t>
 <t id="513622">You want to stay here - you can.</t>
 <t id="513630">Change of plan. Let's get those Yaki disruptor plans.</t>
 <t id="513632">You're still living with your poppa and you want to give me relationship advice?</t>
 <t id="520002">A friend of mine called them tinboats until we got into fight with them, that changed his mind. You know they're supposed to have come from Earth to build new worlds?</t>
 <t id="520006">Don't know. Never spoken to him.</t>
 <t id="520102">Yeah, let's have a look at the Ксенон.</t>
 <t id="520104">No, let's go and pay the Паранід a visit.</t>
 <t id="520201">You'd better wait here.</t>
 <t id="520203">It's my health I'm worried about, anything happens to you and the Don's promised to remove parts of me I'm pretty attached to.</t>
 <t id="520205">I wish it.</t>
 <t id="520301">Great, obviously the Ксенон holiday destination of choice. Let's hope they've signposted that M0 for the tourists.</t>
 <t id="520302">And it said 'friendly welcome' in the tour guide. I just hope it's right about the M0 being here.</t>
 <t id="520401">Okay, computer, let's scan for cargo containers. (Add beeps for computer) And let's hope they don't know who my father is, that'd probably make them really angry.</t>
 <t id="520404">Nice, but not a crystal.</t>
 <t id="520405">You'd think it was my birthday.</t>
 <t id="520406">Come on crystal...come to daddy...</t>
 <t id="520407">It's got to be here somewhere.</t>
 <t id="520408">That was close.</t>
 <t id="520409">I'm complaining to Ксенон tourism, they don't signpost anything.</t>
 <t id="520410">Come out come out where ever you are. Come out little crystal.</t>
 <t id="520411">So much space, so much...time to realise you're talking to yourself.</t>
 <t id="520412">All this effort, you think the Ксенон could've managed a decent gift shop.</t>
 <t id="520413">Crystal? Check. Black? Check. Time to get the Bazani out of here? Check!</t>
 <t id="520502">I've got scorch marks all over the ship and nearly had a hole in me, but no crystal.</t>
 <t id="520505">No.</t>
 <t id="520601">Here goes. If at first you don't succeed...</t>
 <t id="520604">If that's your pep talk, I don't want to hear your put downs.</t>
 <t id="520606">Those little robots almost destroyed every living thing this side of the universe!</t>
 <t id="520702">Safely onboard.</t>
 <t id="520704">It's the proper way to do these things - last minute every time.</t>
 <t id="521201">Wait here I'll meet you when I get back...</t>
 <t id="530002">Yes.</t>
 <t id="530004">I'm going to ask you what to do. That's what the Don recommended.</t>
 <t id="530008">I'm sure the Аргон authorities would be very...</t>
 <t id="530010">(Pause) I'd be very grateful. (Pause, uncomfortable) Why? What did you have in mind?</t>
 <t id="530012">How could I say no?</t>
 <t id="530102">Yeah, those missiles've caused enough trouble. We take out the Yaki's secret weapon then we're back in the game.</t>
 <t id="530103">Yes, let's take these disruptors out of the game. (Into - 530201)</t>
 <t id="530104">Well, I've got the computer components, so let's try your amazing super-secret plan.</t>
 <t id="530105">Let's get those plans. Will Jesan still help us?</t>
 <t id="530121">By pick up I'm thinking you just mean collect, right?</t>
 <t id="530122">Let's take these disruptors out of the game.</t>
 <t id="530201">So, what's the big plan?</t>
 <t id="530203">Very mysterious.</t>
 <t id="530205">10,000 credits worth of computer components it is then.</t>
 <t id="530303">Work?</t>
 <t id="530305">And he'll help us?</t>
 <t id="530402">What are these components for? The Yaki need to upgrade to play the latest games or something?</t>
 <t id="530901">That's the station.</t>
 <t id="530903">This is a pirate sector, flying slowly is suspicious!</t>
 <t id="530905">How close? (worried) And for how long?</t>
 <t id="530907">Sure, travel slowly. Cos, the Yaki aren't going to find it suspicious when I give their space station a haircut! Here we go.</t>
 <t id="530917">You do know we're being shot at?!</t>
 <t id="531001">Oh yeah, someone's suspicious! At least if we stay close to the station they can't use their disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="531002">Hurry it up back there.</t>
 <t id="531003">They really don't like us doing this. Or are they just trying to kill you? That I could understand.</t>
 <t id="531004">Okay, we just got popular again!</t>
 <t id="531106">I'll message Ban, let him know we're coming. I want to see what he makes of these plans.</t>
 <t id="531303">That baka just spaced me!</t>
 <t id="531602">No, I'll have to try again.</t>
 <t id="531801">For the missile plans, what was it you want me to get again?</t>
 <t id="531803">I've got the components. Where should I put them?</t>
 <t id="531807">What station was Jesan on again?</t>
 <t id="531810">The components?</t>
 <t id="531812">The computer components?</t>
 <t id="531814">No.</t>
 <t id="540205">Well, I...</t>
 <t id="550202">Then let's ask him. We know he wants the crystals but he doesn't know Ban's found a way to neutralise his disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="550204">Right. If Thomus lets him know we're transporting the crystals, we can give him a nice little surprise.</t>
 <t id="550206">They surrender and there'll be no more.</t>
 <t id="550209">I can't believe I've met someone who talks more than you! You being around is actually going to be peaceful.</t>
 <t id="550211">Okay, time to give the Yaki our surprise.</t>
 <t id="550215">Looks like you lost your edge, boys. You going to come quietly?</t>
 <t id="550216">Guess not. All ships attack!</t>
 <t id="550218">Everyone ready? The decoy should be here any moment.</t>
 <t id="550220">You get anything on that disappearing ship?</t>
 <t id="550222">Pull a Bonnis from a hat, then blow up a Паранід trader?</t>
 <t id="550224">I've seen the ship again, it tricked a Паранід into flying into an asteroid. If it is Daveed Zincfeld someone must've eloped with his assistant, cos he's sure in a bad mood. You think it is Sohnen?</t>
 <t id="550226">Whatever it is, I don't think it's good news.</t>
 <t id="550301">Keep the Yaki off that convoy!</t>
 <t id="550312">Give it up Ion, you're outnumbered.</t>
 <t id="550313">Surrender and live Yaki.</t>
 <t id="550314">Not so helpless this time, hey?</t>
 <t id="550402">He must be on that ship there.</t>
 <t id="550404">Carefully, we need him alive, Saya.</t>
 <t id="550502">Disengage your drive and prepare to transfer ships.</t>
 <t id="550504">I understand you got innocent people killed, so you understand unless you're a good little priest you're going to be tasting space.</t>
 <t id="550505">Signal Noah, tell him we have Ion aboard.</t>
 <t id="550519">That's lucky, I've already got the Black Crystal, so that's one we don't need to look for.</t>
 <t id="550521">Nope, only got that.</t>
 <t id="550802">Near the crystals and near Ion again.</t>
 <t id="551002">Not just me. I have a guest.</t>
 <t id="551005">It's you that's made the mistake, Ion. The planet you showed Thomus wasn't Earth.</t>
 <t id="551009">Believe your own eyes, this is Earth.</t>
 <t id="551010">Who told you it was Earth? Come on, Ion can't you see they were using you? Was it the Yaki? Was it the person in this ship?</t>
 <t id="551012">We can't create jump events. It's fantasy!</t>
 <t id="551015">What matters is stopping him from opening a gate to that planet!</t>
 <t id="551017">But it's not Earth, who knows where that gate'll take us. And if he's prepared to kill...but then you'd understand that.</t>
 <t id="610102">Only lead we've got though isn't it?</t>
 <t id="610104">Then let's try one of my contacts.</t>
 <t id="610106">You'd be amazed how much partying you can fit in between prison, Пірат and Armageddon. Set your course for the trading station in Імператорські Шахти.</t>
 <t id="610302">He's one of Miria's contacts.</t>
 <t id="610304">So was I.</t>
 <t id="610306">We need some help...</t>
 <t id="610308">Then they would have found the asteroid he crashed into. Want to explain why a lowerlife can dodge asteroids and a Паранід can't? I need access to Кола Жреця  so I can build a mine, can you get me that?</t>
 <t id="610311">I'm more worried about how much this is going to cost us.</t>
 <t id="610313">Thanks for your support. You make me feel all warm inside.</t>
 <t id="610704">Julie?!</t>
 <t id="610902">How is the mining proceeding?</t>
 <t id="610905">We need to get that factory constructed for when they break through, oh and we'd better keep an eye out for our Sohnen friend.</t>
 <t id="610907">Isn't there some place you'd rather be?</t>
 <t id="610908">The great Nolmancketnun advised that that is to be expected and I bow to his wisdom.</t>
 <t id="611403">Good work! Nolmancketnun will be pleased. It is to be transfered aboard my ship.</t>
 <t id="611405">Surely a superior being knows.</t>
 <t id="612101">Sorry, Saya, that holiday will have to wait. I've already got the credits.</t>
 <t id="612103">Want to get in line for your third eye? I've got the credits.</t>
 <t id="612106">The feeling's mutual. Good news you're gonna get your holiday time. I'll meet you here when Nolman gets in touch.</t>
 <t id="612107">I'll see you later. Try not to start any wars while I'm gone.</t>
 <t id="612109">That's what I'm afraid of.</t>
 <t id="612110">Holiday over Saya, I've got the credits we need.</t>
 <t id="614407">Then you'll know that the energy waves it gives off cause mutations in a Паранід's reproductive organs. That's why a lowerlife has been asked to help you.</t>
 <t id="614409">I have pictures if you...</t>
 <t id="614411">Yes, your excellence.</t>
 <t id="614413">Yeah, let's get out of here before he asks for a check up.</t>
 <t id="614421">I don't know. I'm not sure I want to find out what it does, but at least we've stopped Ion and Sargon.</t>
 <t id="614423">Did you just say 'quiet'?</t>
 <t id="614425">If. Sargon told Ion what Ion wanted to hear. Who knows what's true, or where this thing would lead us. Do you want more of those ships suddenly turning up?</t>
 <t id="706203">Mine too.</t>
 <t id="710102">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="710104">And what am I supposed to say? Hi, I know you've never met me, but I'm your son. Oh, and by the way, are you a traitor?</t>
 <t id="710106">(Tense, irritated) Yeah, just great, Saya.</t>
 <t id="710301">This is...this is Аргон Security Vessel 267 to Kyle Brennan. Stop your ship immediately.</t>
 <t id="710302">I repeat, this is...</t>
 <t id="710304">(To himself) Where've I heard that before? (To Kyle) I have my orders. Stop your ship immediately and...</t>
 <t id="710305">He should've stayed in his coma. Computer, scan that asteroid.</t>
 <t id="710307">(Beginning to realise the importance) Nividium?</t>
 <t id="710309">Great, that wreck almost got me killed first time round. (Deep breath) Okay, Computer, hold onto your hat. I'm taking us in.</t>
 <t id="710311">Why did I get up this morning?</t>
 <t id="710312">Where's he gone?</t>
 <t id="710314">Not without you.</t>
 <t id="710320">We've got to stop them.</t>
 <t id="710322">I'll take them out.</t>
 <t id="710324">I'll get them!</t>
 <t id="710802">What happened in there?</t>
 <t id="710804">So, why go alone?</t>
 <t id="710808">It's under control, Eagle Flight.</t>
 <t id="710812">Kyle Brennan and...(reluctant) Julian Brennan.</t>
 <t id="710905">Let's not do this over an open comm..</t>
 <t id="710907">You ever meet a Гонер Priest called Dogun?</t>
 <t id="710909">There's a priest, Ion, who thought he'd found Earth. He got Dogun killed.</t>
 <t id="710911">How much is it worth? Any of it?</t>
 <t id="710913">Then what do we do? Surrender to the Хаак? Don't think they'd listen.</t>
 <t id="710915">Are you saying we started it?...(Penny drops) The Nividium. Has the Nividium got something to do with the Хаак?</t>
 <t id="710917">You think I don't know how that feels? I lost my past because of you, my friend because of the Хаак, and two Earth obsessives almost got me killed!</t>
 <t id="711501">Nooooo!</t>
 <t id="720206">But what do they want it for? Nividium's not really used for anything.</t>
 <t id="720210">Yes.</t>
 <t id="720213">Okay, let's find out what they're hiding.</t>
 <t id="720215">But why such big attacks? And why on us?</t>
 <t id="720216">Nividium.</t>
 <t id="720219">Why are the Хаак so interested in it?</t>
 <t id="720307">Hey, that was there when I got the ship, I just haven't had chance to clear out.</t>
 <t id="720310">What are you doing poking around?</t>
 <t id="720312">If you're that bored I can probably tap an adult vidfeed for you.</t>
 <t id="720314">You know I could've asked, Miria, or Mi Ton or anyone else to operate this equipment for me.</t>
 <t id="720316">Just configure it.</t>
 <t id="720703">You want to come or not?</t>
 <t id="720706">Had things to do. Come on, let's go.</t>
 <t id="720902">We have permission. Transmitting ID.</t>
 <t id="720904">The great Nolmancketnun did not have time to prospect asteroids, so he sent me as his humble servant.</t>
 <t id="721003">Got through a lot doing what?</t>
 <t id="721101">Try scanning that.</t>
 <t id="721103">Can you scan that?</t>
 <t id="721302">Who knows? I thought it was just a metal.</t>
 <t id="721502">Looks like their work.</t>
 <t id="721504">Wait, I've got something.</t>
 <t id="721506">We have clearance...</t>
 <t id="721902">Do you think they're hiding it because of the Хаак attacks? I mean once they started losing stations, it would make sense to move it.</t>
 <t id="721905">I don't think this is a patrol!</t>
 <t id="721912">If they've hidden it that means the Паранід knew the Хаак were targeting it! Nice of them to tell us. What's worth so much they let everyone keep suffering these attacks?</t>
 <t id="721915">Shimatta!</t>
 <t id="721917">Armanckessilon's the Паранід Sargon killed, these guys obviously didn't get the message that - IT...WASN'T...ME!</t>
 <t id="721920">You're attacking the wrong person!</t>
 <t id="722101">And you navigate for Terracorp convoys?</t>
 <t id="722103">You suggesting the Паранід've started a magic act?</t>
 <t id="722106">Where's he going out here?</t>
 <t id="722107">Now you see it...looks like everybody's getting in on the disappearing act.</t>
 <t id="722111">Yeah, but this isn't the only cloaking device we've seen is it?</t>
 <t id="722115">I told you, I didn't kill Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="722119">Change the soundbite.</t>
 <t id="722121">Justice? I'm innocent!</t>
 <t id="730003">Trouble with a capital T.</t>
 <t id="730006">What's going on and where's Saya?</t>
 <t id="730008">Of course I have! I arranged to buy a crystal from him, but after the Хаак attacked, he flew off - straight into an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="730010">Look, you ask Miria...</t>
 <t id="730012">But what about the fact the Паранід were hiding their Nividium? They knew the Хаак wanted it. And you can't tell me there isn't a connection between a ship that can disappear and spacestation that can cloak itself!</t>
 <t id="730015">This is transfer vessel 8 7 departing en route to Аргон.</t>
 <t id="730017">If you know what's good for you, Ion, you'll keep that mouth shut.</t>
 <t id="730019">They haven't. Ban's giving us a choice.</t>
 <t id="730021">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="730023">The jump drive's been disabled, if we don't get it online we're not going anywhere.</t>
 <t id="730301">How's that jump drive looking?</t>
 <t id="730303">Make it quick, we've got Аргон security on intercept.</t>
 <t id="730305">I'll use disruptors. I just hope they know we're on their side!</t>
 <t id="730306">I'm going to try for a gate.</t>
 <t id="730317">Hurry it up!</t>
 <t id="730319">Our shields are almost gone!</t>
 <t id="730321">Oh, that's where I've been going wrong...</t>
 <t id="730323">They're shooting at us...</t>
 <t id="730328">We're out of here!</t>
 <t id="730329">We're still here.</t>
 <t id="730331">No hurry, it's only an escape attempt!</t>
 <t id="730333">This had better...</t>
 <t id="730341">I told you to keep quiet.</t>
 <t id="730346">I've already told you to stay quiet!</t>
 <t id="730348">You don't keep quiet, Ion, I'll jettison you to slow them down.</t>
 <t id="730349">Last warning, Ion, keep quiet!</t>
 <t id="730350">Ban hinted that Don Tony Marani might help us.</t>
 <t id="730352">Yeah? You wait 'til you meet his daughter!</t>
 <t id="730902">Why did Ban tell me to come to you?</t>
 <t id="730908">Ion. The man who wanted the crystal. The one that got your daughter kidnapped. Now, you say one more word, Ion and I'll hand you over to the Don.</t>
 <t id="740006">Whatever they're up to, it isn't here. They're heading out in convoy.</t>
 <t id="740011">Ion, what's this crystal like?</t>
 <t id="740014">Just tell us about the Seed.</t>
 <t id="740017">What do I need to do?</t>
 <t id="740602">Yeah, we'll have to wait for the next convoy.</t>
 <t id="740605">I don't see you volunteering.</t>
 <t id="741108">Кола Жреця  co-ordinates set, jumping.</t>
 <t id="750002">Володіння Герцогу.</t>
 <t id="750004">Well, then let's not get caught.</t>
 <t id="750206">And no one's going to Earth. Did Sargon say anything to you about the Паранід?</t>
 <t id="750208">Yet they suddenly have similar technology and know about the Seed? What's this ship that's following us, Miria?</t>
 <t id="750301">One jump drive ship.</t>
 <t id="750402">And we're too far away to see anything.</t>
 <t id="750404">Out here?</t>
 <t id="750416">Why are we going there?</t>
 <t id="750503">Let's get into that system. The sooner we get proof, the sooner I get my life back!</t>
 <t id="751002">It's cloaked, but I've got it on my scanners. They must highlight it so patrol ships don't crash into it. We're going to have to disable the cloak.</t>
 <t id="751004">Ban Danna said they take a lot of power. We knock out the power, we knock out the cloak.</t>
 <t id="751010">Well, no, they're Paranids.</t>
 <t id="751017">Yeah, only you just told them who you are...</t>
 <t id="751101">I'm picking up large amounts of Nividium. It's the gates! That's what they needed Nividium for!</t>
 <t id="751104">You can make gates, but no one knows how to create a jump event. There's this seed crystal...but only one, so why do they want so many gates?</t>
 <t id="751106">We'd better follow.</t>
 <t id="760104">They're trying to manufacture a seed crystal. That's why they kept this secret, build lots of gates, open their own trade routes. They'll control the economy!</t>
 <t id="760106">A lot of credits. I bet that's why they told Sargon to take a hike.</t>
 <t id="760112">Remind me to punch the next Паранід I meet.</t>
 <t id="760128">What about the other end?</t>
 <t id="760130">Wait! You don't know what the event will do to you.</t>
 <t id="760132">Let's get after him.</t>
 <t id="760150">You really think you can program that thing?</t>
 <t id="760152">Think's not good enough, Ion. You'd better do it or we're all going straight to bazani in little pieces!</t>
 <t id="760153">We're trying to help you, you baka!</t>
 <t id="760154">Where are we going, Ion?</t>
 <t id="760157">Tell a Паранід something's fragile and they'll hit it with a hammer to check.</t>
 <t id="760170">I'm getting a power surge.</t>
 <t id="760175">Yeah...I skipped science at school.</t>
 <t id="760177">Yeah. I get you on the station or we're all dead.</t>
 <t id="800001">And you said it was me that was always getting into trouble.</t>
 <t id="800009">We're on your side you baka!</t>
 <t id="800102">Am I pleased to see you.</t>
 <t id="800104">Earth, we hope. He entered the event.</t>
 <t id="800107">No chance of an apology and an account full of credits instead?</t>
 <t id="800109">Every ship we can get.</t>
 <t id="800110">You know that major attack everyone thought the Хаак were massing for? I think it just started!</t>
 <t id="800115">If the Хаак win they'll destroy everything.</t>
 <t id="800116">Паранід baka ne. If only we could tell the Хаак that we'll stop mining.</t>
 <t id="800126">Transporting over.</t>
 <t id="800141">Then who's this?</t>
 <t id="800154">I'm on my way.</t>
 <t id="800165">You had to say quiet didn't you? You just had to say it!</t>
 <t id="800169">We got the proof. Not that that will help if we're all dead!</t>
 <t id="800303">It's Sargon.</t>
 <t id="800305">You want to risk Sargon doing something with the wormhole?</t>
 <t id="800307">Good luck, Saya.</t>
 <t id="800310">Ion, it's Julian. What's happening?</t>
 <t id="800312">Say again.</t>
 <t id="800314">Find an escape pod.</t>
 <t id="800317">There's something not right here.</t>
 <t id="800318">One of Sargon's tricks. This is going to be difficult.</t>
 <t id="800326">What about you?</t>
 <t id="800329">Computer! Eject! Eject!</t>
 <t id="800341">We need to get back and warn the others.</t>
 <t id="800400">(Julian's breathing - space suit.)</t>
 <t id="800411">I'm here, Saya, just about...</t>
 <t id="800432">Considering I flew through a disintegrating spacestation in a collapsing wormhole and my spaceship blew up, I think I'm relatively okay thanks.</t>
 <t id="810000">This is Julian Brennan calling Don Tony, I need to raise some credits, Miria said to come to you.</t>
 <t id="810001">This is Julian Brennan, I'm looking for another job.</t>
 <t id="810002">This is JB, do you have anything for me, Don Tony?</t>
 <t id="810003">This is JB, looking for another credit run.</t>
 <t id="811000">I'm looking for some credits can you help?</t>
 <t id="811001">I need to raise some credits, any ideas?</t>
 <t id="811002">I need some credits for the mission.</t>
 <t id="811003">I'm trying to raise some credits, how can I do that?</t>
 <t id="901004">You ready?</t>
 <t id="901095">How much?</t>
 <t id="902222">Yeah?</t>
 <t id="902225">Just one question.</t>
 <t id="950002">Another cargo container</t>
 <t id="950003">Let's see what's in this one</t>
 <t id="950004">I wonder what's in here</t>

 <t id="950008">Free upgrades</t>
 <t id="950009">I love free stuff</t>
 <t id="950010">Free is good</t>
 <t id="950011">I wonder what's over there</t>
 <t id="950012">I guess I must've made them angry</t>
 <t id="950013">Hey, you stop shooting I'll get out of here</t>
 <t id="950014">Found another one</t>
 <t id="950015">I wish these fighters would get lost</t>
 <t id="950016">You made a right mess of this M0</t>
 <t id="950017">I'm glad this thing's out of commission</t>
 <t id="950018">I'm glad this thing isn't operational</t>

 <t id="350327">I know where you live.</t>
 <t id="350329">You think you clever? You think I can't find out?</t>
 <t id="350330">Hey, little woman, shouldn't you be at home with the husband?</t>
 <t id="350332">I'm gonna take you I'm gonna feed your entrails to a Спліт rani, I'm going to gut you from one side to another, I'm going to...</t>
 <t id="350334">What do I pay you guys for? Shoot them down.</t>

 <t id="450009">You mess with Marani, you die by Marani hand.</t>
 <t id="450012">If you hurt her, I'll feed you and your family to the fishes.</t>
 <t id="450013">What? The Crystal not enough, you have to take my daughter too?</t>
 <t id="450015">You're brave enough with a friend, let's see how tough you are on your own.</t>
 <t id="450101">You don't getaway that easy, you lousy Yaki. You and me got business.</t>
 <t id="450301">You think you a tough guy? You sentence a little girl to death and you tough, huh?</t>
 <t id="450303">Listen, Yaki scum, maybe we can make a deal? You, I spit at you, I don't give a bowl full of craz for you, but my daughter, she never do nothing wrong. So, you take Don Marani and you let her go. You hear me?!</t>
 <t id="450305">You don't have the Stone? That means they'll kill her! They kill my beautiful, little girl. And that's your fault you lousy rat, so you'd better help. You owe me. And you help me, I help you teach them a lesson for making you look a dimwad. The Don knows things about the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="450307">Sure. You get my daughter, my beautiful little girl, I tell you all about them.</t>
 <t id="463801">It's you.</t>
 <t id="463803">You might've saved my daughter, but if you laid one finger...</t>
 <t id="463805">(Calm) One finger... My contacts they found the factory. They also find these Yaki scum want two more crystals. You stop them. You mess them up? That's good with me.</t>
 <t id="463808">I just got you home, Miria.</t>
 <t id="463813">You lay one finger. One finger....</t>
 <t id="730502">We're not here for games, Miria. Follow us back to my station.</t>
 <t id="730601">Where you going, space cadet? How far you think you going to get without our help?</t>
 <t id="730904">You're just a business deal, so don't go getting no big ideas.</t>
 <t id="730907">Who's that?</t>
 <t id="740008">JB's the expert on stealing crystals.</t>
 <t id="740012">You gonna trust him? He got a lot of my friends dead!</t>
 <t id="740016">Then we attach a tracker. Get this thing once they get where they're going. I'd do it for you, (pointed) but my best man got killed.</t>
 <t id="740018">Fly the drone in along the ship. You gotta land in the right place or they'll detect you.</t>
 <t id="740133">Signal's coming through strong.</t>
 <t id="750001">...So, where is this installation?</t>
 <t id="750003">Sure, (of) course. You know you get caught in Паранід space they've gonna use your insides for table decorations.</t>
 <t id="750210">And you better look after that ship.</t>
 <t id="750420">How you get to be so famous, when you such a dimwad? Get over here you carrasucking rephead.</t>

 <t id="810005">You go find my daughter, or I fry your bastu!</t>
 <t id="810007">Miria better be all right. Better than all right, or I scrape your eyes out with a spoon. But you need credits, you do this for Don Tony.</t>
 <t id="810008">I'll help you cos it make Miria happy. You make Miria unhappy, you spend your life eating through a straw. Try this for credits.</t>
 <t id="810009">You take care of my daughter, I take care of you, sending details.</t>

 <t id="810017">I look like an employment service? I don't got nothing for you.</t>
 <t id="810018">I got better things to do than talk to you right now. I'm not interested.</t>
 <t id="810019">I take care of business myself. I got nothing for you.</t>
 <t id="810020">The amount of heat you got on you, you come here? I don't deal with no dimwad craz that gets so well known to the law.</t>
 <t id="810021">I look like your uncle? You want the job - do it. You don wan it then don't waste my time.</t>
 <t id="810022">I don't have time for no babysitting, go look yourself.</t>

 <t id="2160">You'll need an upgrade to your lasers.</t>
 <t id="2161">You're going to need better weaponry than that!</t>
 <t id="2162">Those lasers wouldn't hurt a spacefly. Time for an upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2170">You'll need more cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2171">You haven't enough cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2180">I get some more missiles, JB, bigger ones.</t>
 <t id="2181">Those toy missiles? You'll need an upgrade!</t>
 <t id="2190">Those shields wouldn't protect you from a rainstorm.</t>
 <t id="2191">You need better shields.</t>
 <t id="2192">Annoying as you can be, I'd like you around for a while longer. You're going to have to upgrade those shields.</t>
 <t id="2200">You'd better get your ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2201">That hull's looking a bit secondhand, you'd better get it repaired.</t>
 <t id="2202">There's a lot of damage, you'd better get that ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2203">You'll need repairs before you go anywhere.</t>
 <t id="2207">No cargo space. Bad weaponry. Lots of damage. You need a new ship or a complete overhaul.</t>
 <t id="2208">That ship's a mess, you need a complete upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2209">That ship's had it, it'll need repairs and upgrades.</t>
 <t id="2210">You're going to need a fighter for this.</t>

 <t id="500301">Saya has a lot to teach you about women. You know how long I been waiting?</t>
 <t id="500303">Hey, you really know how to make a girl feel special. I send you information, but you better treat me better. I can help you in all sorts of ways, if I like you.</t>

 <t id="500601">You gonna upgrade that ship or just think about it, JB? The Ксенон will fry that secondhand spacehulk.</t>
 <t id="500701">That ship should be good enough for the Ксенон. If you think you can handle them the way your poppa did.</t>
 <t id="500801">Hey, JB, I thought you ask my poppa for information for a reason. Now, we gonna go, or you gonna sit there springcleaning your joystick?</t>
 <t id="500802">(Ironic) I love a man of action. You better get yourself sorted sometime, JB.</t>
 <t id="500807">Oh good, holiday time for JB. You better bring me a present.</t>

 <t id="510001">Hey, spacebrain, you come here to get into Паранід Прайм, or what?</t>
 <t id="510101">You change your mind and want to go visit the Паранід instead?</t>
 <t id="510103">Well, it's simple in a 'no way can you do it' sort of a way. You have to get to a Паранід in Паранід space, but they closed the borders. You can try talking to a border patrol at the 'east' gate, but Паранід are about as friendly as a squash mine.</t>
 <t id="510104">Then we should be in Ксенонський Сектор 101.</t>
 <t id="510105">Then we should be in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="510108">Then let's go and meet my contact on the trading station in Імператорські Шахти.</t>
 <t id="510109">Aren't you supposed to be raising the money?</t>
 <t id="510110">Let's go see if Armanckessilon's still in Elena's Fortune. If there's one thing that'll keep a Паранід waiting it's credits.</t>
 <t id="510111">You think? I mean, we really need that crystal and we only left Armanckessilon in a sector full of Хаак. No need to rush back there, really.</t>
 <t id="510120">(Sarcastic) Let me think...Hey, I have an idea, maybe we go talk to my Паранід contact in Імператорські Шахти? You know? The one I suggest before?</t>
 <t id="510121">Let's talk to my Паранід contact on the trading station. And bring your credits they're the universal language.</t>
 <t id="510130">You got the money, you got the girl, well the Паранід. Now there's a picture I didn't want in my head.</t>
 <t id="510140">Let's go to Elena's Fortune then.</t>
 <t id="510150">Hey, I'm all for keeping Паранід waiting but they go sour faster than a first date in a sewerpit, so let's go see him. He's waiting near the trading station.</t>
 <t id="510156">You think? I mean, we really need that crystal and he was getting on so friendly with the Хаак.</t>
 <t id="510170">You not well known enough, you don't get a little more notorious, you don't get onboard. Help out a little and take out some Пірат then you can dock. Hey, just make sure they not Marani first.</t>
 <t id="510171">Seems they no like you, you better get friendly with them, or you no able to dock.</t>
 <t id="510201">There's one thing a Паранід like more than anything else and that's showing off his big gun.</t>
 <t id="510302">At least we know the Yaki no have the crystal.</t>
 <t id="510304">I got a contact on the trading station here. He's a Паранід with only two eyes, which in Паранід terms makes him as popular as gas in a spacesuit. This guy'll do anything to get the money for his third eye.</t>
 <t id="510601">Well, that was a pathetic display of machismo, you want to get on now? We go to the Emperor Mine trading station.</t>
 <t id="511101">You scared of Паранід or something? How come you're not going to see my contact?</t>
 <t id="511301">That's my contact - Nolmancketnun.</t>
 <t id="511303">From one two eyed creature to another, you still accept our money though, don't you Nolman?</t>
 <t id="511305">We need to get a message to a Паранід called, Armanckessilon. He has a crystal we want to buy.</t>
 <t id="511307">Do you have that, JB?</t>
 <t id="511310">Hey, you turn up on a first date with no money, you not gonna get to dance and you try to blast your way into Паранід space, you bet Armanckessilon won't sell you the crystal. So, get your skinny hide out raising those credits.</t>
 <t id="511404">You ever met a Паранід worth their own hype? Problem is if Nolman wants that much, Armanckessilon ain't gonna want pocket change.</t>
 <t id="511701">Well, what you wait for? Get the credits and get to him!</t>
 <t id="511802">What are you waiting for? Pocket money? You get flying, you get trading or we're not going to get anywhere.</t>
 <t id="511804">You waiting on a lotto ticket or what? Let's get those credits, flyboy.</t>
 <t id="512103">Play nice. You want the crystal from him remember? You can tell him he's an arrogant baka after you got it.</t>
 <t id="512105">Hey, you good at kissing bastu. Any time you want to come over and kiss...</t>
 <t id="512107">Watch out, JB. Хаак incoming.</t>
 <t id="512110">That useless yellow streak's running.</t>
 <t id="512112">Clear those Хаак then we able to trade with that no carras Паранід.</t>
 <t id="512113">And more. Looks like they having a party.</t>
 <t id="512202">What is it?</t>
 <t id="512301">Where did it go?</t>
 <t id="512303">You got a fan club you not told me about?</t>
 <t id="512501">Where's he going?</t>
 <t id="512505">His comm's off.</t>
 <t id="512506">What happened?</t>
 <t id="512510">It's not on my scanners.</t>
 <t id="512511">That ship's back!</t>
 <t id="512601">Where are you going, JB? I thought you needed this crystal.</t>
 <t id="513001">One crystal. Why do the Yaki want these things anyway?</t>
 <t id="513003">I wouldn't trust a Yaki with a blunt spoon. Let's get the rest of this stuff and stop them. Which one you wanna get next?</t>
 <t id="513101">Two down, one to go, JB. Let's find out what those damned Yaki got hidden.</t>
 <t id="513201">Two down, one to go, JB. Let's stick it to the Yaki and get that other crystal.</t>
 <t id="513301">Well that's everything. What are you going to do now, JB?</t>
 <t id="513303">You come over all religious?</t>
 <t id="513305">My poppa's been messaging me every three sezuras, I better go see him. We make a good team. You come see me and next time, maybe we make the teamwork a bit more personal. Kouun stopping the Yaki, JB.</t>
 <t id="513402">He's on the trading station in this sector.</t>
 <t id="513403">He's on the trading station in Імператорські Шахти.</t>
 <t id="513611">You always this decisive?</t>
 <t id="513621">You sure? You don't wanna just go look at them then change your mind again?</t>
 <t id="513631">Saya say you haven't got a girlfriend, that cos you can't make your mind up and you no ask anyone out?</t>
 <t id="520001">I did the Ксенон in school. Only seen a couple of them.</t>
 <t id="520003">Ксенон came from Earth? Then why so many people wanna go there? Hey, your poppa's from there, yeah? What's he like?</t>
 <t id="520101">You change your mind and want to do the Black crystal first?</t>
 <t id="520103">Then we should be in Імператорські Шахти.</t>
 <t id="520105">Okay.(This now links into the complete Ксенон Mission briefing from D.5.0.05)</t>
 <t id="520202">Nice of you to care about my health, but I don't wait for nobody.</t>
 <t id="520204">I wait, but only if it is because you wish it, not my poppa.</t>
 <t id="520206">Ha! You really think I do it just cos you say? I stay so someone can save your sorry Bastu when you get in trouble.</t>
 <t id="520501">You got the crystal?</t>
 <t id="520503">You gotta get it some time. You gonna upgrade your ship, or try again?</t>
 <t id="520504">You got it?</t>
 <t id="520506">Don't tell me you're giving up. I thought you were a real man. You gonna upgrade your ship, or try again?</t>
 <t id="520507">I come with you. Looking at that crate you got, I think ship salesmen see you coming and rub their hands.</t>
 <t id="520602">You screwed up somewhere. Now get your Bastu in there and don't come back without that crystal!</t>
 <t id="520603">Are you as good as your poppa, or are you gonna run away like a little mouse?</t>
 <t id="520605">You wanna get beat by some little robots?</t>
 <t id="520607">Almost ain't good enough.</t>
 <t id="520701">You have the crystal?</t>
 <t id="520703">About time. You in a hurry to stop the Yaki, or you planning to take the rest of this jazura?</t>
 <t id="520801">Okay, JB - what's next?</t>
 <t id="521202">Where you going? I haven't told you what you need to do!</t>
 <t id="530001">So, flyboy, what you going to do now? You try and get to that station, you're spacedust. Bring a fleet, blow the station up, you don't learn about those fancy weapons. So? Any bright ideas?</t>
 <t id="530003">What?</t>
 <t id="530005">(Put out) Did he? (new plan) And how grateful would you be if I could give you a solution?</t>
 <t id="530009">I didn't ask about the Аргон authorities.</t>
 <t id="530011">Nothing. It was just good to see you squirm. Get me 10,000 credits of computer components and meet me in Зрада Бала Гі.</t>
 <t id="530013">That's one word I never hear, now get going!</t>
 <t id="530101">You change your mind and want to go for those disruptor missiles?</t>
 <t id="530106">He'll still help me. Let's get back to him.</t>
 <t id="530110">Then let's talk to my friend on the Quantum Tube Fab in Зрада Бала Гі.</t>
 <t id="530111">Let's talk to my friend on the Quantum Tube Fab.</t>
 <t id="530115">As long as you aren't our secret weapon, cos then even I'm putting money on the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="530116">You wanna look round and see which one of us has a bright idea? Cos I don't see no light filament appearing above your head.</t>
 <t id="530120">Let's pick Jesan up.</t>
 <t id="530130">Let's push those thrusters and head to Olmancketslat's Treaty then.</t>
 <t id="530202">The plan? I'll tell you that when you remember to get hold of those computer components. About 10,000 credits worth.</t>
 <t id="530204">You want to find out more about me, you got to find the courage to ask.</t>
 <t id="530302">There's a computer expert in Зрада Бала Гі. He done some work for us in the past.</t>
 <t id="530304">Let's just say I hope you didn't have savings in the PXK bank.</t>
 <t id="530306">He'll help me. He's on the Quantum Tube Fab, let's dock there.</t>
 <t id="530401">See, that wasn't so hard.</t>
 <t id="530501">Can't you find your way round a system? I'm on the Quantum Tube Fab. You'll find it listed under the confusing name - Quantum Tube Fab.</t>
 <t id="530702">Hi, Jesan. Meet my friend, JB.</t>
 <t id="530704">It's a flying visit. We need help to get some weapons plans off a space station. We brought you some computer components as a little thank you.</t>
 <t id="530706">(Flirting) Of course...(Straight) JB will fly you.</t>
 <t id="530708">Don't worry, you boys will get on just fine.</t>
 <t id="530709">I'll meet you here when you're done. Jesan, you might want to remind JB to check the stuff my poppa sent him. He can get a bit lost sometimes.</t>
 <t id="530808">That was a real no carras move back there, JB, you want to do this or no?</t>
 <t id="531101">Did JB behave himself?</t>
 <t id="531103">I'm very grateful, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531105">Soon, soon. We got some other business to see too now. Oh, and Jesan, that stuff under your bed...I hope your mama never finds out about it. Come on JB.</t>
 <t id="531304">Yeah, but he made sure you had a suit. You take me somewhere I don wanna go you gonna get transported somewhere without your head, and that's if you get lucky.</t>
 <t id="531401">I thought you were taking those plans to Ban Danna? I've never seen Аргон One. Shimatta, it's been a long time since I saw Аргон Prime. We have a few difficulties with the authorities.</t>
 <t id="531601">You get the plans?</t>
 <t id="531603">Okay, we'll see you later, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531605">So, what do you want to do now?</t>
 <t id="531701">Hi, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531703">Now play fair, both of you.</t>
 <t id="531802">This time I say it real slow so you can understand. Computer components worth 10,000 credits. That okay, or you want me to write it on your head in BIG letters?</t>
 <t id="531804">If it didn't mean I have to wash them I'd put them straight up your bastu, to see if that help you remember. We go to the Quantum Tube Fab in Зрада Бала Гі. Okay?</t>
 <t id="531808">Can you move nearer the comm, I wanna see if your mama had to tattoo your name on your forehead for you. He's on the Quantum Tube Fab in Зрада Бала Гі! You better get it together before you try and visit those Yaki again.</t>
 <t id="531809">You still got those components I asked you to get?</t>
 <t id="531811">Yes.</t>
 <t id="531813">Yes.</t>
 <t id="531815">Then you better get some more and meet me back here you spacebrain.</t>
 <t id="540202">Afraid I'll tempt some spacehappy fleetboys into a life of piracy?</t>
 <t id="540301">Okay, JB - what's next?</t>
 <t id="540401">We still gotta go pay those Ксенон a visit. You ready for that?</t>
 <t id="540501">We still gotta go get the crystal from those happy Паранід.</t>
 <t id="550520">You wanna check your ship see if you got the rest of the things as well?</t>
 <t id="550522">Pity, we could've found some other way to spend the time. So, which one you wanna get now?</t>
 <t id="730501">You're a man who takes his time. (Flirty) You take your time over everything?</t>
 <t id="730901">Looks like you've lost your pursuers.</t>
 <t id="730903">Poppa's decided to go straight. He talked to Ban Danna, and he said he help us if we help you.</t>
 <t id="730905">You'll hand him over to me! Until then...we've sorted out fake ID for you, so where we headed?</t>
 <t id="740007">Convoys are our speciality. Poppa?</t>
 <t id="740009">(reproving) Poppa.</t>
 <t id="740010">I transfer back to my ship.</t>
 <t id="740019">They're coming through. Deploying drone.</t>
 <t id="740101">You gotta dodge those sensors, JB</t>
 <t id="740102">They're firing!</t>
 <t id="740105">They've lost it.</t>
 <t id="740106">Good flying, they just see a blip and think it's space debris.</t>
 <t id="740107">You dodged them.</t>
 <t id="740108">Like candy from the baby, yes?</t>
 <t id="740109">They got it. Deploying another one.</t>
 <t id="740110">You shoulda met Alfredo, he was much better.</t>
 <t id="740111">Alfredo would be laughing right now. Sending in another drone.</t>
 <t id="740112">You supposed to be landing the drone, yes? No getting it shot.</t>
 <t id="740113">The drone's taking too much damage!</t>
 <t id="740114">Next shot and you've had it!</t>
 <t id="740115">You trying to get the drone destroyed?</t>
 <t id="740116">Don't let it get shot no more!</t>
 <t id="740117">You got 100 metres and closing.</t>
 <t id="740118">Fifty meters.</t>
 <t id="740119">Twenty metres.</t>
 <t id="740120">Put it down there.</t>
 <t id="740121">Land it, JB!</t>
 <t id="740122">Typical man! Couldn't find the spot even when it was painted!</t>
 <t id="740123">You missed it, try again!</t>
 <t id="740124">Go left!</t>
 <t id="740125">Go right!</t>
 <t id="740126">Left!</t>
 <t id="740127">Right!</t>
 <t id="740128">You gone too far!</t>
 <t id="740129">Go back!</t>
 <t id="740130">They scanning us, you better move!</t>
 <t id="740131">You're in the scanning beam.</t>
 <t id="740132">That's it you got it!</t>
 <t id="740135">We sit back and follow them now.</t>
 <t id="740136">You getting too close, JB, we got a tracker on there so you no have to fly that close!</t>
 <t id="740301">Well, we miss that one. Let's get back to the gate before the next one comes through.</t>
 <t id="740302">Over here, dimwad. You no find gate, no wonder you can't land the drone.</t>
 <t id="740303">That look like a gate to you? Get over here!</t>
 <t id="740401">I think you hit the Seed.</t>
 <t id="740501">Signal firm.</t>
 <t id="740502">I'm checking. Got them, they're in Heretic's End.</t>
 <t id="740601">It's a good job you stop being a pirate. You lousy at it.</t>
 <t id="740603">Okay, we try...again.</t>
 <t id="740604">It's a good job they got a lot of ships.</t>
 <t id="741109">They Paranids, who knows if they know?!</t>
 <t id="750005">You gonna need a ship with a jump drive, we can't go gate to gate. We can pick one up at our base.</t>
 <t id="750201">JB, you take this ship. Ion and Kyle, you go with Al.</t>
 <t id="750209">Expensive. Now let's get to Володіння Герцогу.</t>
 <t id="750302">Nice steal, but it's not what we need.</t>
 <t id="750401">This should be far enough out for their system sensors not to pick us up.</t>
 <t id="750403">You want we fly into the middle of the system and say hi? We wait and a ship will come.</t>
 <t id="750405">Standard rule of military tactics, always send patrols to faraway lonely places where they can be ambushed. We capture the ship then use its ID to get into the system. That little ship we picked up that stops them telling anyone what we're doing.</t>
 <t id="750406">Everyone think being a pirate is such an exciting life. Most of it you sit on your bastu waiting. You get good at solitaire. You ever wanna play me at solitaire, I beat your bastu.</t>
 <t id="750408">Okay, JB, go catch our fish. You got ten kilometres before he gets out of our jamming range.</t>
 <t id="750409">Keep hitting him, take his shields out.</t>
 <t id="750410">It's one little patrol ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="750411">Eight kilometres. You better pick it up before he gets out of jamming range.</t>
 <t id="750412">You almost out of space!</t>
 <t id="750413">He getaway, we gonna have the whole Паранід fleet on our head!</t>
 <t id="750414">You get caught this for nothing, you bastu!</t>
 <t id="750415">Okay, now, quick, we head out to the system rim.</t>
 <t id="750417">So we don't get seen and we don't die, that make sense?</t>
 <t id="750418">Keep up, JB.</t>
 <t id="750419">You going the wrong way, you baka.</t>
 <t id="750501">Okay, the rest of you guys, jump this system and we call you when we need you.</t>
 <t id="750504">You got a life? When did that happen?</t>
 <t id="750601">Where are you going, JB?</t>
 <t id="750602">You think we risked everything so you could go sightseeing?</t>
 <t id="750603">You wanna get your life back then you have to get your bastu back in that system.</t>
 <t id="750604">This installation so big it goes into a different system, or you get lost again?</t>
 <t id="750701">He's calling for help. We gotta jump out of here, or the whole Паранід Fleet will be on us.</t>
 <t id="750702">Let's just put that down as you distracting the fleet, hey, JB and let's go again.</t>
 <t id="750705">Okay, same play, we wait for a ship. You shoot his shields down, you steal the ship.</t>
 <t id="750706">You gotta hit those shields, make him think he's gonna be destroyed, then he'll ditch the ship, yeah?</t>
 <t id="750707">You trying to train the Паранід Fleet? Steal the ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="750708">We're jamming him, go!</t>
 <t id="750801">Okay, I'm running low on power, let's jump back to Легенда Фарнгама, take a break and come back again.</t>
 <t id="750901">Okay, JB, let's try again.</t>
 <t id="751001">This installation invisible or something? Cos I see nothing.</t>
 <t id="751003">How do you find a cloaking device?</t>
 <t id="751005">Try the Hornets, those are the best for hitting stations.</t>
 <t id="751006">I think they just realise we not Paranids. (We see some Паранід ships coming in on an intercept) You fly, I shoot.</t>
 <t id="751008">Take that Паранід baka ne!</t>
 <t id="751009">Call yourself a man?</t>
 <t id="751011">Well, I'm sorry, who made you an Argonopedia? (more firing) Call yourself a Паранід?!</t>
 <t id="751012">Who's lower life now?</t>
 <t id="751013">You wanna use those three eyes, well then dodge this! (more firing)</t>
 <t id="751014">You shooting those power things, or just taking pictures?</t>
 <t id="751015">Ha ha! What you think of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia now, ey?</t>
 <t id="751016">You wanna keep a secret Паранід? You want a secret you go to a Marani!</t>
 <t id="751018">Only...I could be lying! Take this from the Yaki!</t>
 <t id="751019">Come on, JB, get rid of that cloak!</t>
 <t id="751020">Power down 50%. You hit another two and the cloak will be gone!</t>
 <t id="751021">Power's down. Hit some more.</t>
 <t id="751022">Shoot it, JB!</t>
 <t id="751023">You wanna shoot it or kiss it? Fire, JB!</t>
 <t id="751024">Hit one more power thing and it's gone! We see your secrets now Паранід!</t>
 <t id="751025">You hit those power things, I take care of these rectemites.</t>
 <t id="751026">Keep shooting the station, these guys are mine.</t>
 <t id="751027">You wanna do this before we run out of shields and die, JB?</t>
 <t id="751102">I thought no one knew how the gates worked.</t>
 <t id="751105">There's a convoy forming, they on the move.</t>
 <t id="751107">They're heading for the North gate. We can jump sectors and get ahead of them. I'll call the others.</t>
 <t id="751404">Poppa.</t>
 <t id="760001">The tracker got them Паранід out on West side.</t>
 <t id="760101">What are they doing?</t>
 <t id="760107">Since when did that stop a Паранід?</t>
 <t id="760110">They losing it!</t>
 <t id="760126">Where you want this?</t>
 <t id="760134">We've got more problems than that.</t>
 <t id="760140">You better hurry, JB, it's looking bad out here.</t>
 <t id="760141">We got a gateship, powering up.</t>
 <t id="760201">That thing's interfering with the gate. We don't get this sorted we'll be trapped here.</t>
 <t id="800000">JB!</t>
 <t id="800002">Just shoot them!</t>
 <t id="800003">This thing flies like a pregnant mosscow.</t>
 <t id="800004">Any chance you could hit them before next jazura?!</t>
 <t id="800005">I'd stand more chance being rescued by a Yaki!</t>
 <t id="800007">There are too many of them. We're Bonnismeat.</t>
 <t id="800008">When are these Паранід gonna notice we on their side?!</t>
 <t id="800010">Concentrate on the Хаак you baka ne!</t>
 <t id="800011">I always say Паранід were born with their head up their bastu.</t>
 <t id="800026">This is not looking so good.</t>
 <t id="800033">Poppa, you say thank you, properly!</t>
 <t id="800105">It look like you get here just in time.</t>
 <t id="800117">Bit late for that right now.</t>
 <t id="800118">You stop being a pirate and suddenly everyone want to kill you.</t>
 <t id="800123">There's another wave of them</t>
 <t id="800140">They've gone suicidal! Hey! You want to crash, go play with an asteroid!</t>
 <t id="800302">JB, the station.</t>
 <t id="800408">You bet your bastu!</t>
 <t id="800428">Hey? JB where are you? You gonna keep me waiting again? Get your bastu down here so we can go to the party.</t>
 <t id="800431">Are you okay, Julian?</t>
 <t id="810025">JB, I knew you'd come see me.</t>
 <t id="810026">It's for me poppa, so keep you nose out! I got something you can do for me, JB.</t>
 <t id="810027">I knew you'd want to make me happy. I got a job that will make me very happy.</t>
 <t id="810028">I can't talk right now, Poppa's listening. You better go.</t>
 <t id="810029">You figure that out yourself, JB. I'm paying you to do the job, go do it.</t>
 <t id="810030">That's for me to know and you to find out, bye, JB</t>
 <t id="902044">Check your 'starmap'.</t>
 <t id="902221">You get that crystal, I give you an extra prize.</t>
 <t id="902223">Yeah. I won't frag your useless Bastu.</t>
 <t id="902226">You ask me if I got a sister, I take your eyes out with a spoon.</t>
 <t id="902227">You could trade, or race, or my father might have some work you could do. Just get off your bastu and do something!</t>
 <t id="902404">I'm so glad I came to help.</t>
 <t id="902405">You really have to work on your charm you know.</t>
 <t id="902406">They craz sucking lowcrawlers. Lousy cheating pirate wasters. They no worth the breath to say their stinkin' name.</t>
 <t id="902407">Several million credits to some collectors.</t>
 <t id="902408">You wait, you find out.</t>
 <t id="902409">Hey, you know how many people take the pizola out of programmers? You get shot at, he plays games and eats pizza all day, which one sounds like the idiot now?</t>
 <t id="902410">Only the things they found out about and that isn't close to what he's done. One day he'll stop being a crime boss. Then he'll be a real nightmare. Bazani, I gotta get my own place!</t>
 <t id="902411">I got a list. Why you want to be on it?</t>
 <t id="902413">A two eyed Паранід. Won't tell me how he lost the other eye, but he'll do anything for the credits to get it back. And when I say anything, I don't want you getting the wrong idea. That sort of picture in your head will get you in trouble.</t>

 <t id="1220">Okay, okay, let's get this clear. I got other things to do than talk to rectemites like you.</t>
 <t id="2000">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="2010">No.</t>
 <t id="2070">Try checking your gravidar, dimwad, we've got company!</t>
 <t id="2071">Watch out!</t>
 <t id="2072">You keep flying this badly, we're history.</t>
 <t id="2140">Great you just about got us killed...</t>
 <t id="2141">Shields gone! Game over...</t>
 <t id="2290">(Instead of yawn)Doo, doo, doo.</t>
 <t id="530701">Miria!</t>
 <t id="530703">(Dismissive) Hi. (Excited again) So, how long you here for, Miria?</t>
 <t id="530705">You know it's not computer components I'm interested in. Hey, the plans'll be easy. We'll have to go in my ship though; it's the only one with the right equipment. And, er, (hopeful) I'll need a pilot.</t>
 <t id="530707">(Disappointed) Oh.</t>
 <t id="530801">Okay, okay, I thought this pirate station was in Olmancketslat's Treaty, right?</t>
 <t id="530802">Okay, okay you need a map? This sure isn't Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530804">Okay, okay. Enjoy the view on your own time. Get back on course, or I'm chucking you overboard.</t>
 <t id="530805">You really want to see more of space? Okay...let me help you see it real close up. (Jesan then spaces the player)</t>
 <t id="530806">I'll say hi to Miria for you Chickeeboy.</t>
 <t id="530807">Surprised you came back, I've seen Bonnis with more guts.</t>
 <t id="530902">Okay, okay. Scanning factory. Take it slow, don't look suspicious.</t>
 <t id="530904">(Ignoring him and scanning) Okay...okay...they're shielded, but you see that channel I've marked? We get close to that we can run a scan.</t>
 <t id="530906">I'm going to need at least 60 seconds and don't go faster that 120 m/s or I won't be able to hold the lock.</t>
 <t id="530909">This ship gets damaged, you get damaged, okay?</t>
 <t id="530910">You wearing a blindfold up there?</t>
 <t id="530911">This is my ship. Remember that, or you're floating home.</t>
 <t id="530912">Okay...okay, I'm getting something.</t>
 <t id="530913">Keep it close.</t>
 <t id="530915">Okay, okay, I'm getting in.</t>
 <t id="530916">Keep it steady.</t>
 <t id="530918">I've lost it. Wish Miria could see what a dimwad you are.</t>
 <t id="530919">Okay, okay, I thought you said you were a pilot.</t>
 <t id="530920">Lost it again. No faster than 120m/s for sixty seconds, Dimwad!</t>
 <t id="530921">If Miria was flying, we'd've done it by now! Do it again.</t>
 <t id="530922">Space is this big and still you hit something?</t>
 <t id="530923">Just follow the markers, okay, space monkey?</t>
 <t id="530924">Okay, okay, sixty seconds at 120, follow the markers.</t>
 <t id="530925">Hey, I don't mind telling Miria that you couldn't do one simple thing. Fly the channel and try not to crash.</t>
 <t id="530926">Hold it steady.</t>
 <t id="530928">It's hard to concentrate with that laser tower shooting at us.</t>
 <t id="530929">Okay, okay, any chance you could stop getting my ship shot up?</t>
 <t id="530930">Okay, okay, just follow the markers.</t>
 <t id="530931">Okay, okay, just follow the groove.</t>
 <t id="530932">Stop shaking the ship.</t>
 <t id="530933">I got a stream. Hold it for sixty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530934">Just another twenty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530935">Just thirty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530936">Ten seconds!</t>
 <t id="530937">Five.</t>
 <t id="530938">You're going too fast!</t>
 <t id="530939">Slow down!! I'm losing it!</t>
 <t id="531005">I've got it! Get us out of here and back to my station.</t>
 <t id="531102">You're a better pilot. This guy should be flying passenger routes.</t>
 <t id="531104">When will I see you again?</t>
 <t id="531301">Let's stick to the mission? It's Miria I'm doing a favour for, so get back on track.</t>
 <t id="531302">I'm only doing this for Miria, and I won't think twice about spacing you and explaining the accident.</t>
 <t id="531501">Okay, my base is Зрада Бала Гі. You were there, remember?</t>
 <t id="531502">You want me to draw you a map to Зрада Бала Гі? I've got some crayons somewhere.</t>
 <t id="531503">Okay, okay, look, much as I like your company, I'd rather get back to Miria.</t>
 <t id="531604">I'll look forward to it. Particularly more time with Mr 'can't follow instructions' here. He's bags of fun.</t>
 <t id="531702">Miria! Oh, you brought company again.</t>
 <t id="531901">If I'd really wanted your sweaty bastu on my ship I'd've bought some air fresheners and sent you an invite. Let's get home and you can get lost on your own time.</t>
 <t id="531902">Bad enough you're hanging around Miria let alone my ship. Turn this baby around, point it at home and get out of my life.</t>
 <t id="531903">You might have nothing better to do, but I've got a girl I want to get back to. Ejector activated....</t>

I've had a look at this equipment...they must be stretched at Аргон command - it's ancient! We're going to have to get close to whatever we scan to get any readings.</t>
 <t id="800421">Here you are. They're looking for you.</t>
 <t id="800423">The hero of Heretics End? Confirmed recipient of the senate ribbon? Voted best looking bastu in Аргон Women's weekly? I think not. There's a big party waiting for you. Senator McCarthy organised it herself. (Beat) He'll be back you know. As soon as he's finished talking to Earth.</t>
 <t id="800425">Ban hasn't forgotten. He thinks we can find a way to communicate with the Хаак and stop this properly and we've got people analysing Sargon's projector to see what we can find out. But in the meantime, everyone gets to live in peace that bit longer because of you.</t>
 <t id="800427">Glad you remembered. Thought you might've got too important to talk to us.</t>

 <t id="410101">This is where Thomus was last. He is, well, he is rather a recluse. However, there is a friend of Thomus's on the Trading Station we'll have to talk to him to find out where Thomus is.</t>
 <t id="610001">Ion says that the Seed can be found inside an asteroid in Кола Жреця . However, as the Паранід borders are still closed, only Паранід can build mines there. You'll have to find a way to persuade someone to help you.</t>
 <t id="610002">Once you have, you will need to build a super-factory, the details of which are attached to this message. All the information we have about the seed is that it is some sort of high energy vortex. A vortex powerful enough to tear a hole in space, so be cautious!</t>
 <t id="610003">Ion has given this information very easily and we know nothing of this creature who he claims tricked him, so be wary, Julian. I feel in my heart that this Sargon cannot be Sohnen, they were peaceful and there are no reports of them manipulating other races. May you tread the path of wisdom with your eyes open.</t>

 <t id="350005">Do not exert yourself, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="350007">My name is Ion (pronounced eon). Noah asked me to find you.</t>
 <t id="350009">Yes, yes, that was most regrettable ...Your friend Saya is here with your ship, so as soon as you are well you may find the person who did this.</t>
 <t id="350102">The police say that a pirate called Don Tony Marani took the stone. His ship - the Talon - is docked in Легенда Фарнгама for repairs. It has a jump drive but we have given Saya Khosama a jump scanner, so if he refuses to surrender the crystal you can follow him. When you have the crystal I will meet you. May peace find and comfort you.</t>
 <t id="551004">You're making a big mistake, Noah. You should let me go.</t>
 <t id="551006">I wouldn't expect you to believe. You wouldn't even believe your father.</t>

 <t id="551013">He said he knows how to, he understood the projector! (Grasping a chance for redemption) But he still needs something. A seed, that's what makes the jump events. He found one the ancients left in some sort of installation. I meant no harm, Noah, you must believe that. It was Earth!</t>
 <t id="551015">No...</t>
 <t id="551016">He said his name was Sargon. A Sohnen. He told me how the projector worked and that the other crystals would programme the jump event. That it would take us there - to Earth. You have to see, Noah, all these years!</t>

 <t id="300011">As the five races lived in their fragile peace, they faced a new threat. Faceless, Невідомий and devastating, the Хаак swept through all those who stood in their way.</t>

<page id="300945" title="Reporter" descr="" voice="yes">
 <t id="700001">...extensive casualties suffered across both space and planetary installations. We haven't got accurate figures yet, but, with fire still sweeping through a number of affected areas, those figures are just going to keep getting higher.</t>
 <t id="700004">Strong words, Senator.</t>
</page>

<page id="300946" title="Information Station" descr="" voice="yes">
 <t id="25001">You may repair any ships you own at a shipyard or wharf, select your ship from the trade menu and press the right arrow to repair the hull. The repairs will be marked at a percentage level allowing you to make partial repairs if you do not have enough credits to initiate a complete repair cycle. You may also repair your ships at your own HQ, assuming you have one.</t>
 <t id="25002">There are several means of equipping large ships. Familiarize yourself with the operation of the Transporter Device offered at the Гонер Temple. You can dock the ship at a Shipyard and after escaping from the initial trade screen, will see a secondary trade screen that offers ship equipment. Or you can drop the equipment out of the cargo bay of one ship and pick it up in another just like any other cargo.</t>
 <t id="25003">Shipyards sells a combination of factories and combat or transportation craft. Wharfs only deal in the repair and sale of ships.</t>
 <t id="25004">You can buy police licenses from trading stations across the universe. Some special stations may also sell them. As to why you need them, well you don't actually need to buy yourself one except for the receipt of bounty payments from helping to defend a sector against Пірат and other enemies. Obviously this license only extends as far as the race that owns the sector. Pirate sectors are lawless and dangerous places. There is no-one there who would honour a police licence. Best not advertise you hold one to all and sundry when you are in a Pirate sector!</t>
 <t id="25005">These may well be the Markus Spacefly. They are known to live in space and are attracted to the energy fields created by ships and weapons. For many jazuras the Спліт have used them as fuel.</t>
 <t id="25006">Jumpdrives are specialised pieces of equipment that require a minimum of an M4 class ship, and energy cells to power the devices core. Once installed, ensure you have enough energy onboard for the journey you wish to take, - bear in mind that different sized ships will require different amounts of energy to make the jump. Once you have enough energy, target the sector you wish to jump to. You will see all sectors within range with your current energy load as being highlighted. Once you have selected the sector, you will be able to choose which gate you wish to arrive at. Having selected the gate, your ship will automatically initiate the countdown procedure and engage your jumpdrive once the core is fully powered.</t>
 <t id="25007">Transporter Devices work only within a limited range. Ideally your target ship should be within 4km of your vessel. It must also be in your control. Once within range, open your ships console up and select the target, then select Transporter Device. This will beam you from your own cockpit, to the cockpit of the target ship. Bear in mind that if the target ship does not have a transporter device installed, you will either need to take a walk in space, or have both ships dock at a station in order for you to return to your original vessel.</t>
 <t id="25008">M6 vessels are somewhat unique in that there are a limited number of stations with which they can dock, for example, equipment docks, shipyards and wharfs, as well as your Player HQ, should you have one.</t>
 <t id="25009">This button does all sorts, depending on what you have targeted. Selecting a station and pressing it will have your ship automatically dock at that station, selecting a ship and pressing it will have you follow that ship, and selecting a jumpgate and pressing it will send you through that jumpgate. It should also be noted that you will be able to engage your SETA whilst in autopilot unless you are scanned, which greatly speeds up going through jump gates and docking.</t>
 <t id="25010">They are goods outlawed by some races such as spaceflies, spacefuel, spaceweed, swamp plant, slaves and squash mines. They have been outlawed for a number of reasons, from war conventions to preservation of endangered species.</t>
 <t id="25011">Slaves are outlawed everywhere. Other goods depend on the race. Look through your sector map for any factories that are set at some distance from the main sector coordinates. Some of these may produce goods considered illegal to other races.</t>
 <t id="25012">If you are scanned and do not eject the goods in time, Sector Authority will take action. First they will ask you to eject the illegal cargo. If you refuse they will fire on your ship and call for additional support.</t>
 <t id="25013">You can a) mine ore or silicon with a Mobile Drilling System or b) you can just build a mine on an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="25014">Apart from a Mineral Scanner and a ship that has the ability to use a Mobile Drilling System, you need an Ore Collector, XL cargo capacity and of course the Mobile Drilling System itself.</t>
 <t id="25015">The Теладі Vulture and Паранід Demeter can both be equipped with the Drilling System and both ships can carry XL cargo. You may also be able to use a TL for this purpose, however due to their size, manoeuvres may understandably be more complicated.</t>
 <t id="25016">The Ore Collector can be bought at Теладі and Паранід equipment docks. The Mobile Drilling System can be bought at all Аргон, Паранід and Теладі Equipment Docks.</t>
 <t id="25017">You need to fly within a few hundred metres of an asteroid and shoot it with the Mobile Drilling System until it breaks apart. Then you can collect the fragments with the ship, providing a Ore collector is installed on it.</t>
 <t id="25018">Ore, silicon and nividium.</t>
 <t id="25019">Ore is needed to produce weapons, shields and Quantum Tubes amongst other things.</t>
 <t id="25020">Silicon is required for the production of missiles, shields, crystals and satellites. Generally all high tech wares that have some level of artificial intelligence built into them will require some amount of silicon for their manufacture.</t>
 <t id="25021">A very small number of Теладі Trading Stations stock it and a small number Паранід Space Jewelleries use it for Majaglit production. You may find other stations that deal with the protection of endangered species also require nividium for purposes which we cannot disclose here.</t>
 <t id="25022">Minerals can only be found on asteroids. The only way to find out what an asteroid contains is to scan it with a Mineral Scanner. The Mineral Scanner also determines the asteroid's yield.</t>
 <t id="25023">Asteroids can be found in many sectors. The sector with a high number of asteroids in Аргон territory is Пояс Руди. There are of course other sectors where asteroids are equally prolific.</t>
 <t id="25024">The Mineral Scanner can be bought in all Аргон Equipment Docks.</t>
 <t id="25026">The methods used to extract ore and silicon differ markedly. For best results make sure you place an ore mine on an asteroid containing ore, and of course a silicon mine on an asteroid containing silicon.</t>
 <t id="25027">Unfortunately no, we do not currently have the technology to mine Nividium directly. But you can use the Mobile Drilling System, or a Hornet missile.</t>
 <t id="25029">The idea is simple: Buy Low, Sell High. Search for something that is being sold at a lower price than normal and buy it. Then go and find a station that is offering a better price than you paid. The greater the difference, the greater the profit! It will help you if you learn how much the different wares cost, and how cheap they can be, as well as how expensive.</t>
 <t id="25030">Trade the wares you can carry, and extend your ship's cargo hold and add Engine Tunings as you go - but be careful! Don't buy a Cargo Hold Extension with the Credits you need for your next load of cargo! Later on you can buy a bigger ship and trade in your old one to pay for your next load of cargo.</t>
 <t id="25031">I recommend you visit the Теладі and buy their Best Buys Locator and Best Selling Price Locator upgrades. These will access the trade menu list of all the stations in your current sector and tell you which ones offer the best deals.</t>
 <t id="25032">Place a Navigation Relay Satellite in any promising sector. Then, if you want to check the prices in that sector, bring up the Navsat's Info screen and activate the Best Buys and Best Selling Price Locators. They will interface with the Navsat's comms system and report the best deals.</t>
 <t id="25033">The best way to find good trade runs is to go out there and explore. Find one sector where stations are competing to sell the same ware, and another sector where stations are fighting to buy it. That, is a very good trade run. And if you make profit on the way back, then you have a very good run!</t>
 <t id="25034">It is indeed! Trading Stations buy and sell wares at guaranteed prices which can be very helpful. But even better are the Merchants who visit Trading Stations. They have some of the best trading deals you can find; and will buy, sell, or exchange wares. But be careful, not all of them are honest!</t>
 <t id="25035">Many traders make their money by using Sector Traders and Galaxy Traders. You provide a fully equipped transport ship, capital, and the right trading software, and the pilot will trade for you. Give them time, and they can become extremely experienced.</t>
 <t id="25036">A TS-class ship with a fully-extended cargo hold and the Trade Command Software Mark 3, which you can buy from the Теладі. I advise you to fit it with good shields as it is an expensive investment that you don't want to lose too easily.</t>
 <t id="25037">You need a Sector Trader ship with a pilot that has an experience level of at least 8. Galaxy Traders live a dangerous life, so look after them - they demand a ship with at least 25MJ of shielding, plus Fight Command Software Mark 1 and Mark 2. It is also a good idea to provide a Jump Drive so they can jump out of trouble should enemies attack!</t>
 <t id="25038">Not at all! But it may save you money in the long run as the pilots almost always buy one for themselves when they reach Experience Level 12, and that costs more than if you provide it in the first place.</t>
 <t id="25039">You can order any ship you own to go to any station you wish to trade with. But to use it to trade remotely, you must fit your ship with the Trading System Extension. Then, once your other ship has arrived at its destination you can access its Information screen and Trade with the station it is docked at.</t>
 <t id="25040">Inside and outside, you get a comm. list. The people who are available and willing to talk appear on this list. Just click their name and they'll answer if they want to. You do have to be close to stations if you're not docked though.</t>
 <t id="25042">Check your mission log. It's all written in there.</t>
 <t id="25043">Building an HQ is an important decision. You will only have one, and the location you put it in will be the center of all your action in the future. What is best really depends on your plans for the future. Are you more interested in the strategic benefits that the HQ can bring or is the repair capability the most important? Wherever you put it make sure you will be able to protect it in the future!</t>
 <t id="25044">Well many recommend the use of plasma weapons whenever possible. Sure they get you a lot of bang for the buck, but personally I would recommend looking into some alternatives too. As a pilot not bound to the restrictions of the Аргон armed forces, you could for example have a closer look at wide area lasers.  They are perfect to use against Хаак clusters when they've just jumped in. You shoot at the whole damn cluster at once and don't have to hit every single one of them. Be careful however when you have wingmen as this weapon can easily lead to friendly fire, or unfriendly fire!  A perfect combination of course is to afford both: Plasma as big as you can get and a wide area weapon both together</t>
 <t id="25045">Check the markets. The times are rough and in times of war and chaos, markets can often offer interesting chances. I have heard of saboteurs ruining factories and driving the prices up for their own good, not that someone like you would do that.</t>
 <t id="25046">Its impossible to tell you one particular factory that will make you the most money. It depends on how much money you have to spend and what the current market situation is. Of course you have to look at the market and the local specialities. For a start it isn't wrong to go for the cheaper factory types. Run a powerplant or maybe a mine before you go up to the bigger stations. You should decide early if you want to continue to run factories as a single money maker or maybe want to build a bigger installation where goods of one of your own stations are the resources for another. In the latter case the local specialities become less important as you can be completely independent from the rest of the market. For such installations also consider combining factories into a complex. The recently developed linking tubes are a perfect way to save money to spend on ships and transportation costs.</t>
 <t id="25047">A nice way to make money can be to collect the wreckage left after battles. Sadly there are many large scale battles these days. If you dare to stay around there, you can often pick up containers and salvage everything from cheap goods to expensive missiles or even shields. You'll also find containers and wreckage in remote parts of inner sectors and hidden in the outer sectors.</t>
 <t id="25048">You can always make some extra money if you look out for containers or other debris floating in the outer regions of sectors. Often what looks like junk at first can be worth quite a lot. Certainly worth the time picking it up. Your best chances are to look where others don't go try in asteroid fields or inside dangerous nebulae for example.</t>
 <t id="25049">Well it depends if you use a mining laser or if you plan to build a full blown mine there. In either case you should get a mineral scanner and search for those asteroids with a high Ore or Silicon content. Building a mine is a large investment but gets you more money in the long run, while mining with a mining laser can be fun and gets you a lot of money quickly. However, this normally requires two ships. One equipped with the mining laser and one with large transport capacity that can hold Ore.</t>

 <t id="711403">Julian, leave them, this is only making things worse.</t>
 <t id="720201">Not just it. The asteroid too. The Хаак had been alone throughout time then the Gunner crashed straight through the middle of their hive systems. They followed it, found us and began to learn about the other life out here. And that was okay, because the other life didn't know they existed.</t>
 <t id="720203">They didn't see a difference between the races. Not at first anyway. Then the Паранід started sending recon missions into Хаак space. They didn't find the Хаак homeworld, but they did find what they were looking for.</t>
 <t id="720208">I agree.</t>
 <t id="720214">The Паранід sent recon in. They must have detected some of the Хаак scoutships. The Хаак saw this recon as a threat.</t>
 <t id="720217">It's always been around in small quantities, but now it's being mined in massive amounts with ships constantly going into Хаак space. There's a simple reason we can't find their homeworld. We're stealing what's left of it.</t>
 <t id="720218">I thought the Gunner might contain starcharts that could help us find Earth. It turns out I wasn't the only one looking for the ship.</t>
 <t id="730018">Why've they released us, Julian?</t>
 <t id="730020">Face the politicians, or make a break for it?</t>
 <t id="730022">So, are you going to fly this bucket, or shall I?</t>
 <t id="730024">Okay, so you fly, I'll fix it.</t>
 <t id="730302">(audio only) It's been taken off line. It'll take me a minute to reroute it.</t>
 <t id="730304">Don't kill any of them, they're on our side remember?!</t>
 <t id="730305">More ships coming in, stay sharp up there.</t>
 <t id="730307">Have you seen the ships they've blocked it with? It's suicide! Give me a moment more, the drive will be online.</t>
 <t id="730315">I'm going to need another minute.</t>
 <t id="730316">I'm almost there.</t>
 <t id="730318">I'm fixing a jump drive not a broken power socket!</t>
 <t id="730320">Then fly evasive.</t>
 <t id="730322">I'm on the last bit now.</t>
 <t id="730324">You're a prisoner that's stolen a ship, what did you expect them to do?</t>
 <t id="730325">Another few seconds.</t>
 <t id="730327">I've got it! Hit the jump button!</t>
 <t id="730330">Ah, that'll be the...one second.</t>
 <t id="730332">(Pause) That's it try it now!</t>
 <t id="730349">Where are we going to jump to, Julian?</t>
 <t id="730351">I hope he knows what he's saying the Don's got a pretty vicious reputation.</t>
 <t id="750203">I wish I could say the same, Ion. The man who named the Хаак, someone with the background you have then...Julian told me about Dogun.</t>
 <t id="750205">Instead he died to save another.</t>
 <t id="750421">Come on, Julian, we don't want to get caught.</t>
 <t id="750502">Good luck, Julian.</t>
 <t id="760105">(Disgusted) It's all about credits.</t>
 <t id="760114">We'll go for the gates. You take Ion where he needs to go. He's coming across, now.</t>
 <t id="760129">One step ahead of you.</t>
 <t id="760131">Only one way to find out. See you on the other side.</t>
 <t id="760202">My jump drive's offline.</t>
 <t id="800407">Earth fleet to Аргон One. May we be of assistance?</t>
 <t id="800416">Julian will join you shortly. I'm returning to Earth. Hopefully I can persuade them to open up contact with us, but they're highly suspicious so it could take some time. Kyle out.</t>

 <t id="2150">I'm a bit busy here, JB!!!</t>
 <t id="2151">I'm a bit busy right now, JB!</t>
 <t id="2160">You'll need an upgrade to you lasers.</t>
 <t id="2161">You're going to need better weaponry than that!</t>
 <t id="2162">Those lasers wouldn't hurt a spacefly. Time for an upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2170">You'll need more cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2171">You haven't enough cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2180">I get some more missiles, JB, bigger ones.</t>
 <t id="2181">Those toy missiles? You'll need an upgrade!</t>
 <t id="2190">Those shields wouldn't protect you from a rainstorm.</t>
 <t id="2191">You need better shields.</t>
 <t id="2192">Annoying as can be, I'd like you around for a while longer. You're going to have to upgrade those shields.</t>
 <t id="2200">You'd better get your ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2201">That hull's looking a bit secondhand, you'd better get it repaired.</t>
 <t id="2202">There's a lot of damage, you'd better get that ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2203">You'll need repairs before you go anywhere.</t>
 <t id="2207">No cargo space. Bad weaponry. Lots of damage. You need a new ship or a complete overhaul.</t>
 <t id="2208">That ship's a mess, you need a complete upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2209">That ship's had it, it'll need repairs and upgrades.</t>

 <t id="320105">I'll transport you aboard. Oh, and say hi to the monk they have let me play with. (Prompting) Dogun?</t>
 <t id="320107">It's not an honour, Dogun. Trust me, I've met him. Come on, JB. Let's get going.</t>
 <t id="320301">Okay, JB, I'm releasing target drones. Let's see if you can still handle a turret.</t>
 <t id="320303">Just some old crystal.</t>
 <t id="320305">It's a rock. Okay, here they come.</t>
 <t id="320306">Looks like you're a little rusty. Want to go again?</t>
 <t id="320307">You've got a couple of different weapons there, JB. Try changing between them.</t>
 <t id="320308">You getting the hang of it, or you want to go again?</t>
 <t id="320309">Is it coming back, or do you want one more go?</t>
 <t id="320310">Okay...Try aiming for them this time, JB.</t>
 <t id="320311">Hey, you miss these and I'm sending Dogun back to have a go.</t>
 <t id="320312">Well, done. You must've been practicing.</t>
 <t id="320315">Just protecting a major Terracorp asset.</t>
 <t id="320317">Me! And this ship. Our technicians would love to have a poke around the modifications the Гонер have made, if we can persuade Noah.</t>
 <t id="320319">Charity's easier when you've got credits in your pocket.</t>
 <t id="320400">Entering Місяць Рінго.</t>
 <t id="320402">Dogun, you never say it's quiet in space.</t>
 <t id="320404">They're your fault, Dogun, that's what they are! JB, we've got company!</t>
 <t id="320406">You believe him?</t>
 <t id="320408">Me neither. Frag him.</t>
 <t id="320409">They're Пірат, JB. Recognise any of them?</t>
 <t id="320411">Oh, good. Are they nice Пірат?</t>
 <t id="320413">Come on, JB, we're getting fried here.</t>
 <t id="320414">Is this thing insured, Dogun?</t>
 <t id="320415">This ship's one of a kind, JB, Noah's not going to be pleased if you let it get blown up. Come to that, neither am I!</t>
 <t id="320416">Try using the rapid impulse laser, JB.</t>
 <t id="320417">Try switching weapons, JB.</t>
 <t id="320418">These guys are good</t>
 <t id="320419">I can't hold them off. There are too many of them!</t>
 <t id="320420">Shields are low. You're going to have to finish these guys off or we're floating home.</t>
 <t id="320421">Hang on!</t>
 <t id="320423">Let's see if we can shake these guys.</t>
 <t id="320424">Here we go!</t>
 <t id="320426">You prefer I let them shoot us?</t>
 <t id="320428">Do I look like a priest?</t>
 <t id="320430">Switch off your shields and prepare to be fragged.</t>
 <t id="320432">Get bent.</t>
 <t id="320433">Hey, pirate boy, you forgot your parrot.</t>
 <t id="320438">Where's there, Dogun?!!</t>
 <t id="320440">We'll have some universal peace. Just as soon as JB's blown these Baka Ne to bits.</t>
 <t id="320442">Gate coming up.</t>
 <t id="320445">Try using the flak cannon.</t>
 <t id="320501">We're taking too much damage, we've got to...</t>
 <t id="320502">Shields gone! We're...</t>
 <t id="320503">Reactor critical! It's going to...</t>
 <t id="320601">Great shooting!</t>
 <t id="320603">No, Dogun, not there, that's the...</t>
 <t id="320605">...control panel. (Resigned) You'd better clean that up. I'm bringing us in to land. Re-entry in ten.</t>
 <t id="350011">I don't give a flying shunt about the equipment! Is he all right?</t>
 <t id="350015">Then you'd better get Julian back on his feet and fast.</t>
 <t id="350016">Are you okay, JB?</t>
 <t id="350018">As long as you're okay, we'd better find this crystal. If this weapon's as powerful as Ion says...</t>
 <t id="350020">Ion's fitted your ship with a jump drive; he said you'd need it.</t>
 <t id="350022">Ion says you'll need a jump drive, but that M5's way too small. Get yourself another ship and meet me at the trading station in this sector when you're ready.</t>
 <t id="350023">Yeah. As if the Хаак weren't giving us enough to worry about.</t>
 <t id="350025">You're going to need bigger guns, JB. Even without us looking for trouble there are enough Пірат and Хаак out there. Pick up something with more firepower and meet me back here.</t>
 <t id="350027">Ion thinks we'll need about seventy units worth of power cells if we are to keep up with the Talon. Pick them up and meet me here.</t>
 <t id="350028">Ion thinks we'll need a jump drive and seventy units worth of power cells to keep up with the Talon, but your ship's too small. Get a bigger ship, bring it here and we'll fit what you need.</t>
 <t id="350029">Ion thinks we'll need a jump drive and seventy units worth of power cells to keep up with the Talon, but you haven't enough cargo space, clear things out or get a bigger ship and we'll fit what you need.</t>
 <t id="350201">According to Ion, the Don's ship is docked at a pirate station to the West.</t>
 <t id="350202">Meet me in Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="350300">That must be the Talon. It's damaged all right.</t>
 <t id="350301">Shame, I was hoping he'd hang around to be friends.</t>
 <t id="350304">Maybe we should've asked for more than just the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350306">Sure! I was born stupid. Let's take these Пірат out.</t>
 <t id="350307">He's engaging his Jump-drive. I'm getting a lock...</t>
 <t id="350308">Got it! Sending you the co-ordinates. Let's get after him!</t>
 <t id="350312">There he is, let's get after him.</t>
 <t id="350314">I think he's heading to the North gate.</t>
 <t id="350315">He's going to the South.</t>
 <t id="350316">I've got him on scanner to the West.</t>
 <t id="350317">I'm tracking him to the East.</t>
 <t id="350318">Quick he's heading out of the sector.</t>
 <t id="350319">Hurry it up he's heading into the sector.</t>
 <t id="350320">We've lost him I'll need to get more power cells for this jump drive. I'll meet you back at Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="350321">I'm all powered up and ready to go when you are, JB.</t>
 <t id="350322">Just don't mess it up again this time.</t>
 <t id="350323">Let's get it right this time, hey, JB?</t>
 <t id="350328">Okay, where do I live?</t>
 <t id="350331">Yeah, I'll go home, right after I've fragged your bastu!</t>
 <t id="350333">Hey, if it gets you to shut up, I'll surrender and let you do it now.</t>
 <t id="350341">Give us the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350343">Hey, there's a lady here you know. Have you no manners?</t>
 <t id="350346">You found him? Don't let him get away!</t>
 <t id="350347">Wow you found him! You sure you need me?</t>
 <t id="350348">Why do we even need the scanner with you here?</t>
 <t id="350501">Come on, JB, we need to find that pirate station it's over to the West.</t>
 <t id="350502">The Talon won't hang around if they hear we're in the sector, we'd better find that pirate station, JB.</t>
 <t id="350503">Nice of you to join me, JB.</t>
 <t id="350701">We're too far away to get a jumplock. We'll have to get closer.</t>
 <t id="350702">Keep those fighters off me! Here's a hint, they're the red ones on your scope!</t>
 <t id="350703">Almost there.</t>
 <t id="350704">You've got to get within '3' k, JB, or I can't get a lock!</t>
 <t id="350705">The signal's weak, come on!</t>
 <t id="350706">I said 'three' kilometres. Were you this bad at kiss chase?</t>
 <t id="350707">Got a positive lock. Just keep up until he jumps</t>
 <t id="350708">Ship locked, waiting for co-ordinates.</t>
 <t id="350709">(Singing) I know where you're going!</t>
 <t id="350710">I've lost him, you've got to get closer before he jumps.</t>
 <t id="350711">I've lost him, JB.</t>
 <t id="350712">You'll have to get closer than that.</t>
 <t id="350713">Пірат give you a rash or something? Keep up with it!</t>
 <t id="350714">Come on, JB! You're flying like a rookie.</t>
 <t id="350715">I got him. Uploading the coordinates to your computer. Let's hurry, JB, he won't stay there forever.</t>
 <t id="350716">Got a positive lock. Sending jump coordinates. Let's get there before he jumps again!</t>
 <t id="350717">He didn't go far. Hit the jump drive, I've sent you the location.</t>
 <t id="350720">You have to keep those fighters off my back. I can't get a lock, JB.</t>
 <t id="350721">Come back, JB! I need your help!</t>
 <t id="350722">Clear those fighters, JB!</t>
 <t id="350723">What was that!?</t>
 <t id="350725">You keep an eye on it, I'll get a lock on the Talon.</t>
 <t id="350726">Where did that ship go?</t>
 <t id="350728">First the crystal, now a ship. We're going to have to get your eyes tested, JB.</t>
 <t id="350729">That was his last jump. His drive's down.</t>
 <t id="350730">His shields have gone. Targeting engines.</t>
 <t id="350731">Keep an eye out for escorts, I'll see what it is.</t>
 <t id="350732">I've got the crystal aboard, let's get it to safety. Bye, bye losers! Come on let's get out of here</t>
 <t id="350736">He's going to jump any second!</t>
 <t id="350737">Two more jumps and he's ours!</t>
 <t id="350738">Let's get close and cosy to him again!</t>
 <t id="350739">Jump co-ordinate lock in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</t>
 <t id="350740">Jump lock acquired!</t>
 <t id="350741">You've got to stop those fighters getting between us and him, JB!</t>
 <t id="350742">You figure we could get a forwarding address for him? Maybe he's on Пірат reunited?</t>
 <t id="350743">Oh, a pirate's life for me...</t>
 <t id="350745">He can't keep running forever, he'll run out of power cells soon. Let's go!</t>
 <t id="350746">There he is, let's get him, JB.</t>
 <t id="350748">Cos, we know where you live.</t>
 <t id="350750">Let's see if he likes this.</t>
 <t id="350751">Surprise! What can I say? We just liked your company.</t>
 <t id="350752">Fancy meeting you here!</t>
 <t id="350753">Come on, JB, I think he's tiring, not many jumps now...</t>
 <t id="350754">You can jump but you can't hide.</t>
 <t id="350759">Scanners check it out okay.</t>
 <t id="351101">Hurry up, JB, we have to get after him.</t>
 <t id="351301">And I heard you never ran out of energy, JB. Pick up some more cells and meet me in Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="351401">It's best we wait here. The Don won't want to get too far from his defences.</t>
 <t id="351604">Over there! It's that ship again.</t>
 <t id="351606">Only ones I've planned.</t>
 <t id="351608">I'll get over to Terracorp HQ, see if anyone in security can identify the ship. Fly safe, JB.</t>
 <t id="352201">That's not everything, JB. You need the jump drive and at least 70 units worth of cells.</t>
 <t id="430202">Does Ban know you're pretending to be an Аргон escort?</t>
 <t id="430204">Since the Хаак started blowing our fleets to bits. I'm here to make sure these ships get through.</t>
 <t id="430206">Ask the Паранід, they can't get enough of it.</t>
 <t id="430208">Yeah. I showed it to a lot of experts.</t>
 <t id="430210">They couldn't recognise it either. Okay, ladies and gentleman of the convoy, our Аргон military escort has finally arrived. If you'd like to proceed on course.</t>
 <t id="430401">Fleet to red alert. All ships to flank speed. Close up in the middle you're leaving too much room!</t>
 <t id="430402">JB!</t>
 <t id="430440">Quick, JB, can you get to that freighter?</t>
 <t id="430441">You're going to have to take out those pursuing fighters, JB.</t>
 <t id="430442">There are too many! Take out those ships!</t>
 <t id="430443">Watch out for any more arrivals and keep them away from us.</t>
 <t id="430444">If you handle the ships that are chasing us, we'll get the others.</t>
 <t id="430445">We're taking too much damage, JB, you have to take more of them out!</t>
 <t id="430448">Cover that freighter or we've lost it.</t>
 <t id="430449">That freighter's taking too much damage!</t>
 <t id="430450">Cover that ship until they get their shields back up!</t>
 <t id="430701">There're too many of them! We're going to have to go for the!</t>
 <t id="430801">The Хаак don't need any help, JB!</t>
 <t id="430803">Aim straight, you baka!</t>
 <t id="430901">Thanks, JB, Terracorp owes you one.</t>
 <t id="430903">And who knows....one day you might get to collect. (To the fleet) Okay, we still need to get to Край Імперії, so keep your eyes on those scanners.</t>
 <t id="431001">Okay, fleet, let's dock and unload.</t>
 <t id="431003">Hey, JB, you want me to pick those drones up for you?</t>
 <t id="431005">Hey, which one of us gave the Stone to the bad guy? Someone's got to keep an eye on you.</t>
 <t id="431007">Then I'll see you there.</t>
 <t id="431505">Hi, JB, any chance of you flying all the way with us? We took a beating last time.</t>
 <t id="440003">I've got your cargo. What's the plan?</t>
 <t id="440005">Original. Anyone brought any decent movies?</t>
 <t id="440008">I'll drop the first drone. You fly it, I'll keep an eye out for trouble.</t>
 <t id="440501">Careful!</t>
 <t id="440502">Watch out for that scanner here!</t>
 <t id="440503">Careful, there's a drone approaching!</t>
 <t id="440504">Nice move.</t>
 <t id="440505">Be gentle with it, JB.</t>
 <t id="440507">If I ever decide to flirt with you, you'll know about it.</t>
 <t id="440508">There's more of them.</t>
 <t id="440509">I think you're through.</t>
 <t id="440513">You don't have to whisper, Noah, he can't hear you.</t>
 <t id="440514">Keep following the passage it can't be much further.</t>
 <t id="440515">The Yaki have put some defences up, you'll have to get through without triggering them, or they'll know we're here.</t>
 <t id="440519">There's a scanner there. Keep out of its range and you'll be all right.</t>
 <t id="440520">You've triggered the automatic defences!</t>
 <t id="440521">What's that?</t>
 <t id="440523">They must have mobile defences, this is going to get tricky.</t>
 <t id="440524">The drone's taking too much damage.</t>
 <t id="440525">Fly closer to Стіна.</t>
 <t id="440526">Go over it.</t>
 <t id="440529">You gotta dodge that scanner.</t>
 <t id="440530">You're almost in its beam.</t>
 <t id="440531">You're going to trigger it.</t>
 <t id="440532">It'll pick you up, move away!</t>
 <t id="440533">Another couple of shots and the drone's had it!</t>
 <t id="440534">Good job we've got another drone, this one's almost gone!</t>
 <t id="440535">Slow down</t>
 <t id="440536">Watch out for the scanners this time.</t>
 <t id="440537">It's firing!</t>
 <t id="440538">You'll have to hide!</t>
 <t id="440539">Try hiding.</t>
 <t id="440540">Take it slowly.</t>
 <t id="440543">Let's not take any chances here, JB, we were lucky they didn't detect it on its way in. Stay in the tunnel.</t>
 <t id="440544">Stay in, JB!</t>
 <t id="440545">How much ear wax've you got? I said don't fly out! Engaging the self-destruct mechanism.</t>
 <t id="440550">There's a turret coming up.</t>
 <t id="440551">There's another scanner.</t>
 <t id="440552">Watch out for that rock!</t>
 <t id="440553">Take out the power conduit.</t>
 <t id="440554">You have to find the power nodes to take out the turrets.</t>
 <t id="440555">Take out the power conduit.</t>
 <t id="440556">That's the wrong target, hit the power node.</t>
 <t id="440557">Come on JB, it's not even moving.</t>
 <t id="440558">No wonder you got caught stealing that spaceship.</t>
 <t id="440559">Brute force won't do it, you have to get sneaky!</t>
 <t id="440601">I'm launching another drone, but be careful. We can't afford to let them to detect us.</t>
 <t id="440602">Don't you play video games, JB? This is the last drone, so don't crash it!</t>
 <t id="440603">Launching another drone.</t>
 <t id="440604">And they let you fly spaceships? I'm not being your passenger again!!</t>
 <t id="440701">They've detected us. They're launching ships!</t>
 <t id="440703">Let's get out of here!</t>
 <t id="440802">At least someone brought a movie.</t>
 <t id="440807">Noah...?</t>
 <t id="440814">Heads up boys, our friend's back.</t>
 <t id="440815">I think we've outstayed our welcome.</t>
 <t id="440817">Let's go!!!</t>
 <t id="440901">Go for the gate!</t>
 <t id="441001">Come on, JB. They hit you with those disruptors, you'll be a sitting target.</t>
 <t id="441003">(Arriving in Південно-Західна Хмарна База/next sector) Everyone okay? Noah?</t>
 <t id="441102">We can't do anything about Ion until we find a way to stop those missiles. Julian? Are you okay?</t>
 <t id="441104">We will find a way to put this right, JB.</t>
 <t id="441106">I'll push for firm information on that ship, we've had enough surprises. I'll contact you when we have anything.</t>
 <t id="460301">What's up JB?</t>
 <t id="460303">Oooh swapsies. Where is she?</t>
 <t id="460305">Okay, you dock at the station and see what you can find, I'll ask around see if anyone else in the system knows anything. First place I'd check, JB, is the BB.</t>
 <t id="460401">Hey, lazy, get on that trading station and get looking.</t>
 <t id="460402">You're going to have to boost your reputation if you want to dock.</t>
 <t id="460403">You would have to fall out with them. Better boost your relations with them, then you can dock.</t>
 <t id="460701">What you got, JB?</t>
 <t id="460704">Lucky you brought me then. I've been playing detective and everyone's pointing us to the silicon mine.</t>
 <t id="460908">Pleasure complex? You mean slaves!</t>
 <t id="460910">I got offered a lot of credits by a Теладі to work in one of those places. He still can't walk straight. It's no place for a little girl, we need to find her and fast.</t>
 <t id="460912">Then what do you suggest?</t>
 <t id="460914">Like what? Hey! You'd better not be suggesting what I think you're suggesting!</t>
 <t id="460916">Come on let's get to Прибуток Теладі. And JB you tell anyone about this and you won't be walking straight. Engaging jump drive.</t>
 <t id="461001">How do you think a Гонер priest got involved with the Yaki? I haven't met one that would hurt a spacefly let alone mastermind a smash and grab raid!</t>
 <t id="461003">I don't know. Not getting shot at on such a regular basis would be a good start. Can't really think of anything else.</t>
 <t id="461005">Where are your roots?</t>
 <t id="461007">You know anytime you want to stop bombing around the universe shooting things we'll find a place for you at Terracorp.</t>
 <t id="461009">No, but if you're going to get shot at you might at least get holiday pay.</t>
 <t id="461011">Er, what about me getting scared?</t>
 <t id="461013">We ever do this again, you're getting waxed and putting on a dress.</t>
 <t id="461014">Okay, JB, don't get closer than five kilometres, or you might scare the Пірат off. Once they've got me, you'll have to tail them.</t>
 <t id="461101">They've taken the bait. The ship's immobilised. You'd better stay close, but don't ...they're coming onboard!</t>
 <t id="461201">You're getting too close, JB. Back off before they see you.</t>
 <t id="461202">You're still too close!</t>
 <t id="461203">Keep your distance, JB, I don't want to be in this get up much longer. This top's making me itch.</t>
 <t id="461204">Nice to know you care, but care from further away.</t>
 <t id="461302">Hey, you forget me, JB?</t>
 <t id="461501">(Angry, whispering) Hey, remember I'm onboard!</t>
 <t id="461601">(Whispering) Okay, we're docking (some clanging and docking noise run under this). Can you get close and cause some sort of distraction so I can get away? Try taking out those mines. Someone's coming I'd better...(signal goes dead)</t>
 <t id="461701">(In the background we hear alarms) I've got away. Stay close but stay undetected, we still have to get out of here.</t>
 <t id="461901">(Whispering) Come on, JB, there's no way I'll be able to get away on my own. Shoot those squash mines!</t>
 <t id="461902">(Whispering) Where've you been, JB? Get me out of here!</t>
 <t id="462202">JB, I've found Miria, but the Yaki have got some sort of transporter dampener. You'll have to get inside to get us out.</t>
 <t id="462204">That's one idea. We'll meet you at the docking area. And hurry up! For some reason the station's leaking air.</t>
 <t id="462211">(Audio only) No can do. The release doors've jammed on the escape pods, we're all trapped. You'll have to get to the doors.</t>
 <t id="462213">Then hurry up! You can get to the pods through an access in the docking area. It'll have a force field over it, take the generator out to get in. Oh, and JB, be careful with my ship!!</t>
 <t id="462216">You'll have to blast the door off each pod.</t>
 <t id="462217">(audio only) That's everyone! Get yourself out of there!</t>
 <t id="462218">You took your time!</t>
 <t id="462220">Can you ask stupid questions? It's my ship, dimwad!</t>
 <t id="462227">Just me and Miria now.</t>
 <t id="462230">Come on, JB! I asked for a rescue, not a taxi pick up!</t>
 <t id="462231">We're losing air here, JB!</t>
 <t id="462232">Er, you want the good news, or the bad news?</t>
 <t id="462234">You're not dead yet.</t>
 <t id="462236">The reactor's leaking. Any minute now it'll blow and we'll be radioactive cinders.</t>
 <t id="462238">Yeah, we just thought we'd stay to keep you company. Get your bastu in here, JB!!</t>
 <t id="462242">You stopped for a leak?</t>
 <t id="462244">JB, we're going to die if you don't pick it up!</t>
 <t id="462245">Another [three] to go.</t>
 <t id="462246">Two more, JB.</t>
 <t id="462247">It's just us now!</t>
 <t id="462248">You want to get out of here, or not?</t>
 <t id="462249">Fly faster, shoot better!</t>
 <t id="462251">There's still another two pods.</t>
 <t id="462252">Three left. Hurry up!</t>
 <t id="462258">They've got laser grids set up. You'll have to take the generators out, or they'll turn you into diced chickadee.</t>
 <t id="462260">That explosion took out the weapon dampeners, you can fire in here.</t>
 <t id="462261">That ship better not have a scratch on it!</t>
 <t id="462262">Are you stopping to look at the sights, or what? Get us out of here!</t>
 <t id="462263">The Pods are grouped together look for a set of hatches.</t>
 <t id="462264">You're breaking up, JB, you must be moving away from us.</t>
 <t id="462265">Signal's clearer, you're getting closer.</t>
 <t id="462268">That's it, JB, first pod away, keep it up!</t>
 <t id="462269">That's another pod keep going!</t>
 <t id="462270">That's the first set, look for the others.</t>
 <t id="462271">The pods aren't all together, so keep your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="462301">I think I know where Miria is, but there are a lot of guards. I'll need you to get me out of here as soon as I find her.</t>
 <t id="462501">You'll need to get to the docking area to transport us. They've got shielding in here.</t>
 <t id="462903">That's everyone, thanks, JB. I'm sure all the ladies here will be pleased to hear you can shoot straight. Let's get back to the Don.</t>
 <t id="462904">Yeah, I'm fine, thanks for asking and yes, I've got the Don's little girl here.</t>
 <t id="462906">Well, as long this 'little' girl was supposed to be 22 then she's fine.</t>
 <t id="463001">Hey, remember I'm on board.</t>
 <t id="463002">Stop firing at the station you idiot!</t>
 <t id="463602">Not quite. You want to explain, JB?</t>
 <t id="463604">Yeah, suspicious how well he knew the inside of a pleasure complex.</t>
 <t id="463606">I thought that was your regular 'Saturday' night.</t>
 <t id="463608">Er, no offence, I think these girls have gone through enough without us handing them over to another pirate.</t>
 <t id="463611">Keep your eyes on the spacelanes, JB. Don't want you getting distracted and hitting any asteroids, do we? Now hit that jump drive and meet me in Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="463612">You gone spacebrain? Where've you been?</t>
 <t id="463613">Keep your eyes on the spacelanes, JB. Don't want you getting distracted and hitting any asteroids, do we?</t>
 <t id="463806">You go after them, I'll take this data to Noah, see what he makes of it.</t>
 <t id="463810">Oh, yeah, nothing to worry about there.</t>
 <t id="550203">So, we plan a little ambush?</t>
 <t id="550208">Glad you could join us. Miria not with you?</t>
 <t id="550210">Glad you missed me. We're heading for the West Gate in Пояс Руди, so fire up those thrusters.</t>
 <t id="550214">And they say real men don't fire blanks.</t>
 <t id="550217">I'll contact Ban and organise the ships we need. Meet us back here in about an hour, okay, JB?</t>
 <t id="550311">You're going to have to help the security ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="550316">We're taking heavy casualties.</t>
 <t id="550317">They're running, get after them.</t>
 <t id="550318">Don't let them get away.</t>
 <t id="550319">Stop those fighters, JB!</t>
 <t id="550401">Where's Ion?</t>
 <t id="550403">We'll have to take his shields down.</t>
 <t id="550507">You recruit Пірат, you're going to get treated like one.</t>
 <t id="550801">It's that ship again.</t>
 <t id="551007">Kyle's not the only one that's been there. I showed my mother the pictures from our spydrone. It's not Earth.</t>
 <t id="610101">I don't trust Ion as far as I could throw him in heavy gravity.</t>
 <t id="610103">Any ideas how we build a mine in closed space? I could talk to my Terracorp contacts, but the Паранід aren't even letting our convoys in.</t>
 <t id="610105">Your contacts? You suddenly got a social life?</t>
 <t id="610301">How do you know this guy?</t>
 <t id="610303">And we can trust him? She's a pirate, JB.</t>
 <t id="610310">You actually managed to out-arrogance a Паранід. You know how hard that is?</t>
 <t id="610312">A lot. So, I'm going to take a well earned break and wait here while you raise the credits.</t>
 <t id="610314">(Teasing) Really? I thought it was Miria that did that.</t>
 <t id="610503">There's trading, or if you're pushed there are jobs on the Bulletin Boards on stations, otherwise you could saddle up and try some racing. Noah says you're pretty good at it.</t>
 <t id="610505">Well, I suppose if you're desperate...</t>
 <t id="610702">Congratulations, Julian, a promotion!</t>
 <t id="610706">Well, that went smoothly enough. Time for you to go and visit the Паранід...Julie.</t>
 <t id="611801">Let's get that Seed thing back to Noah. I don't like having it around. It's got me worried.</t>
 <t id="612105">How many times have you heard that line?</t>
 <t id="612108">Don't know what you mean. I'm just going to relax a little.</t>
 <t id="614412">We'd better get back to Noah, see what we have to do with it. Reproductive Organs?</t>
 <t id="614420">You got it! What do we do with that thing now?</t>
 <t id="614422">Yeah, only a Хаак invasion to worry about now. It feels almost quiet.</t>
 <t id="614424">I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it! Do you think this Seed really makes a jump event? I mean if it does...</t>
 <t id="614426">No! One mysterious alien invasion a jazura's enough. I have a note from my doctor and everything.</t>
 <t id="710101">You'd better go, JB. I'll get this Seed thing back to Ban.</t>
 <t id="710103">Looks like you're finally going to get to meet him.</t>
 <t id="710105">Just be yourself, JB. (Trying to lift him) On second thoughts, try and be someone else, he might like you better.</t>
 <t id="710107">Be careful. Okay? You know what some of these flightjockeys can be like, he even tries to defend himself and he'll be seen as a defector. That goes for you too. Keep that trigger finger still, JB and good luck.</t>
 <t id="720202">Until now.</t>
 <t id="720205">Terracorp alone has shipped fifteen convoys to them.</t>
 <t id="720212">I've put some information together on Terracorp shipments and I think we should start with the installation in Імператорські Шахти.</t>
 <t id="720235">Transporting you over.</t>
 <t id="720301">And what am I supposed to do back here while you're flying round?</t>
 <t id="720302">Let's get to Імператорські Шахти, JB</t>
 <t id="720304">Are we nearly there yet?</t>
 <t id="720305">I just put my hand in something gunky down here. Don't know what it is. I don't want to know what it is. You ever thought about, you know, maybe cleaning this ship, JB? No wonder you're single.</t>
 <t id="720306">This poster by the lockers...is it physically possible to do that without dislocating something?</t>
 <t id="720308">Yeah, yeah. I believe you.</t>
 <t id="720309">Hey, JB. You know that poster? There are some more down here.</t>
 <t id="720311">This girl looks like Miria. And this one...there's no way they're real.</t>
 <t id="720313">And how would you know how to do that?</t>
 <t id="720315">You want Mi Ton to operate your equipment?</t>
 <t id="720701">What are you doing, JB? You need the equipment we have onboard. And, hey, you need me!</t>
 <t id="720702">Oh, right, realise you forgot something did you?</t>
 <t id="720801">Okay, JB, the installation's over to the East.</t>
 <t id="720802">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the west.</t>
 <t id="720803">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the North.</t>
 <t id="720804">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the South.</t>
 <t id="720904">Come back onboard, JB.</t>
 <t id="721001">We'll need to get close up in case of shielding. We scan their storage and processing areas then we'll know how much Nividium's here.</t>
 <t id="721002">It's empty, only small traces of Nividium. They must've shipped it out. Or they've got through a lot quickly.</t>
 <t id="721004">The next installation is in Паранід Прайм. Let's see if that gives us any clues.</t>
 <t id="721005">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within twenty five metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721006">All these technical bits, Ban's gadget mad isn't he?</t>
 <t id="721007">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within twenty five metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721008">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within 50 metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721009">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within 100 metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721010">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within 50 metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721011">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within 100 metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721102">Scanning...negative, no Nividium there.</t>
 <t id="721104">Scanning...no, only tiny trace elements.</t>
 <t id="721202">We need to go to Паранід Прайм.</t>
 <t id="721203">We need to go to Край Імперії.</t>
 <t id="721204">We need to go to Володіння Герцогу.</t>
 <t id="721301">You'll need to take us out to The North. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721303">You'll need to take us out to The East. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721304">You'll need to take us out to The South. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721305">You'll need to take us out to The West. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721401">That's it. I'm running scan...</t>
 <t id="721402">One down.</t>
 <t id="721403">Keep going.</t>
 <t id="721404">Just one left now.</t>
 <t id="721405">Half way there, JB, neat flying.</t>
 <t id="721406">I've got 50% scanned.</t>
 <t id="721407">80% of wreckage scanned. Nearly there.</t>
 <t id="721408">That's it, we've got enough.</t>
 <t id="721409">That should be enough data.</t>
 <t id="721410">Get in closer.</t>
 <t id="721411">Hurry it up, JB.</t>
 <t id="721412">Faster, faster!</t>
 <t id="721413">Come on, show me your moves.</t>
 <t id="721414">Two left.</t>
 <t id="721415">Two down.</t>
 <t id="721416">That's another.</t>
 <t id="721417">Got that one.</t>
 <t id="721418">Yeah, got it.</t>
 <t id="721419">Look for the next one.</t>
 <t id="721420">On to the next one.</t>
 <t id="721501">I'm just picking up the station, no Nividium. There is debris that could be from Хаак ships though.</t>
 <t id="721503">I list five Terracorp convoys coming to this place alone. I logged two of them and they were loaded with Nividium. Where's it gone?</t>
 <t id="721508">Issued for what?</t>
 <t id="721510">Punch the button, JB. Let's get to Край Імперії.</t>
 <t id="721601">This is supposed to be a secret mission, let's get out and get on before we raise any more suspicion.</t>
 <t id="721701">Okay, we're heading out to</t>
 <t id="721801">Take us in, I'll see what I can pick up.</t>
 <t id="721901">That's it and I've got nothing.</t>
 <t id="721903">Could be...</t>
 <t id="721904">Just one more sector to go, JB, let's ditch this patrol and take a look.</t>
 <t id="721908">We didn't kill Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="721913">What's happening, JB?!</t>
 <t id="721916">What's going on, JB?!</t>
 <t id="721918">We've got one on our tail!</t>
 <t id="721919">Let's get out of here, JB, we're not here to fight them!</t>
 <t id="721921">They might be wrong, but they're definitely trying to kill us.</t>
 <t id="721922">Baka ne paranids!</t>
 <t id="721924">Come on, JB, let's go!</t>
 <t id="722001">Let's make this quick and dodge your fan club. The installation is over to the</t>
 <t id="722102">Hey, it was here, one of the biggest installations I've ever seen. It's where most of the Nividium came to. (scanning) No debris. Look, there's no way they could've towed it out of here.</t>
 <t id="722105">There's a ship coming up on us. Looks like a transport</t>
 <t id="722108">I told you! And I got the readings - massive amounts of Nividium. (Excited) I heard rumours the Паранід had a cloaking device, but everyone said it didn't work.</t>
 <t id="722112">I've got Паранід ships coming in through the gate. It's Armanckessilon's family, and they've brought friends. (An even bigger fleet than last time appears). Let's get back to Аргон One. We have to tell Ban about this.</t>
 <t id="722116">I know you're not one to run away from a fight, but let's just get out of here!</t>
 <t id="722201">All those ships are going to do is draw attention, JB. This is supposed to be a secret mission, yeah?</t>
 <t id="722302">We've still got another two installations. Let's start at Паранід Прайм.</t>
 <t id="722303">We've still got another three installations. Let's start at Край Імперії.</t>
 <t id="722304">We've still got one installation left to check. Let's head for Володіння Герцогу.</t>
 <t id="722401">Stop playing with these guys and get out here. It's the intelligence material that matters.</t>
 <t id="722503">Аргон One? Big Ship? Lots of Guns? In Аргон Prime? You must remember it. So, try flying there.</t>
 <t id="722504">You ever hear the one about the spacebrain that flew off carrying Аргон Secret Service Equipment? No! Because they're treading water in a Спліт swamp somewhere. Come on, JB let's get this stuff back to BD.</t>
 <t id="722601">We need to be in Імператорські Шахти, JB, where are you going?</t>
 <t id="722602">This isn't Край Імперії. You're in the wrong place.</t>
 <t id="722603">I was thinking Паранід Прайм not here, as, well...Паранід Прайм's where the installation is!</t>
 <t id="722604">The installation's in Володіння Герцогу. So, what are we doing here?</t>
 <t id="722605">Let's go to Край Імперії, JB!</t>
 <t id="722606">Let's go to Володіння Герцогу, JB!</t>
 <t id="722607">Let's go to Паранід Прайм, JB!</t>
 <t id="722608">Let's go to Імператорські Шахти, JB!</t>
 <t id="723402">I've had a look at this equipment. They must be stretched at Аргон command, it's ancient. We're gonna have to get close to whatever we scan to get any readings.</t>
 <t id="730002">What do you think's going on, JB?</t>
 <t id="800108">Hey, JB! Need some help?</t>
 <t id="800113">Nice war you've found.</t>
 <t id="800120">You find Earth just in time for it to be destroyed. Not the best timing!</t>
 <t id="800122">Where are they all coming from?</t>
 <t id="800143">Three to go!</t>
 <t id="800144">There's still two left, don't let them get through.</t>
 <t id="800145">It's the last one, JB, finish it off!</t>
 <t id="800147">You did it! I have a ship heading your way to pick you up.</t>
 <t id="800148">One more hit and that ship will blow! You have to intercept those fighters!!</t>
 <t id="800149">Shimatta, another hit. They are going to blow!!</t>
 <t id="800151">That was close!</t>
 <t id="800164">Is that it? Or has it gone quiet for a reason?</t>
 <t id="800167">This is not looking good.</t>
 <t id="800168">Did you find out what the Паранід were doing?</t>
 <t id="800304">Forget the station, we've got ships coming from all sides.</t>
 <t id="800306">Good point.</t>
 <t id="800308">Just get after him!</t>
 <t id="800403">We can't!</t>
 <t id="800406">The Хаак don't use the gates. Is it Sargon?</t>
 <t id="800410">What about Julian?</t>
 <t id="800414">But surely after what has...</t>

 <t id="800432">What about Earth?</t>
 <t id="800433">They're running!</t>
 <t id="800437">Shame Julian's not here to see this, he's good at last stands.</t>
 <t id="900231">Well, if Julian can shoot things that fire back, they're space dust.</t>

 <t id="320101">Greetings, Brennansama, thank you for coming. I was most grieved to hear of your father's condition.</t>
 <t id="320104">(Embarrassed) Well, er...</t>
 <t id="320109">We have a valuable cargo that needs transporting, but with all the pirate activity we need someone to operate the transport ship's defences and as we, er, well...</t>
 <t id="410001">(Relieved) Brennansama, I am most happy you are well. We heard what happened and have been trying to discover who took the Stone.</t>
 <t id="410005">Brennansama, it was Ion who stole the Stone! The Don has the second stone Ion needs.</t>
 <t id="410007">We are not sure of their purpose, only that they hold great power. There is a priest, Thomus, he will help us find Ion, if we can find him. Will you come with me?</t>
 <t id="410009">Thomus is normally in Freedom's Reach. I will send the details to you.</t>
 <t id="410301">Thomus's friend is a Теладі trader on the trading station. We should dock there.</t>
 <t id="410302">Oh good, you have docked. Please wait, I will be with you shortly.</t>
 <t id="410303">Oh dear, it appears you need to have a higher, erm, level of notoriety for them to accept you here. I will wait until they will let you dock.</t>
 <t id="410304">It appears you've upset them in someway. Find a way to make amends, or they will not allow you to dock here.</t>
 <t id="410501">Lihimes Eluleis Gebnduis III, Thomus's friend. (we hear Noah activate the comm.) I do hope Thomus is alright.</t>
 <t id="410503">No, friend, we seek help. We are looking for Thomus Beckitt.</t>
 <t id="410505">We can pay. Name your price.</t>
 <t id="410507">A pilot you say?</t>
 <t id="411002">Where is Thomus?</t>
 <t id="420001">Thomus's ship is in the east nebula in this sector. If we are to find Ion we should get to him as fast as possible.</t>
 <t id="420002">Thomus's ship is in the east nebula in Пояс Руди. If we are to find Ion we should get to him as fast as possible.</t>
 <t id="420003">If we are to find Ion we should get to him as fast as possible.</t>
 <t id="420103">Thomus?</t>
 <t id="420105">It's Ion. He's stolen the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="420107">And you were right, Thomus.</t>
 <t id="420201">Can we get to Ban Danna as quickly as possible please, Brennansama? I'm worried about Thomus.</t>
 <t id="430007">We would be most grateful.</t>
 <t id="431002">Brennansama, we too must hurry, time is pressing.</t>
 <t id="431006">Ion has arranged to meet Thomus in Ocracoke's Storm.</t>
 <t id="431101">We should get to Ocracoke's Storm quickly, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="440001">Oh dear, there are a lot of them.</t>
 <t id="440007">I have a lock on his homing beacon.</t>
 <t id="440101">You should tell the other ships to go, Brennansama. We don't want to risk the Пірат seeing us.</t>
 <t id="440201">They appear to have seen us.</t>
 <t id="440301">Be careful, Brennansama. We can't let them detect us. I don't want Ion to get away.</t>
 <t id="440302">We need to stay undercover, Brennansama. We have to discover what Ion is doing.</t>
 <t id="440401">Oh, no!</t>
 <t id="440510">Be careful, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="440511">I hope Thomus is all right.</t>

 <t id="440816">We must get this information to Аргон command immediately. My goodness. Earth.</t>
 <t id="440902">Please, we must return to Аргон now.</t>
 <t id="441101">How can he have found it? What does he mean by a gate?</t>
 <t id="441105">Yes, indeed. I will meet Thomus and find out more.</t>
 <t id="441107">Thank you for your help, Brennansama. I will be in touch soon.</t>
 <t id="550001">Welcome, Brennansama. You have the other crystals? This is wonderful. Wonderful. Now we stand a chance of stopping Ion. Please meet me at the Гонер Temple. Thomus and Saya are here.</t>
 <t id="550201">Well done, Brennansama. If only we knew how Ion was to use these crystals.</t>
 <t id="550205">There have been too many lives lost already, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="550219">Yes, yes, thank you, Thomus.</t>
 <t id="551001">I am relieved to see you, Brennansama.</t>

 <t id="760164">I hope they haven't changed the controls, we must stop this.</t>
 <t id="760171">The station will only take a few more hits.</t>
 <t id="760172">I'm losing contact with the event, you HAVE to cover me.</t>
 <t id="760174">As you can see from the information I'm sending each wormhole needs an energy spine. Without this it will collapse.</t>
 <t id="760176">No energy spine, big wormhole go boom boom! It snaps shut and sends out shockwaves that shakes matter apart for sectors. We have to send out an energy spine from that platform then put gates in position. Understand?</t>
 <t id="760178">Well done, you just passed science. Now, you must get onboard that.</t>
 <t id="800028">The event is now stable. I only hope Kyle got through to Earth. And that it is Earth.</t>

 <t id="800311">It's Sargon. He's trying to change the beam, you must stop him.</t>
 <t id="800313">Sargon's trying to reprogram the beam. You'll have to destroy this station.</t>
 <t id="800315">There's no time, you have to destroy it.</t>
 <t id="800316">You must destroy the station's reactor. It's the only way.</t>
 <t id="800319">Hurry, I'm losing the lock on Earth!</t>
 <t id="800320">He's almost broken the signal.</t>
 <t id="800321">Another few seconds and we'll lose Earth.</t>
 <t id="800322">I'm doing what I can, but you must hurry.</t>
 <t id="800324">You must take out the four power nodes - that will overload the reactor.</t>
 <t id="800325">You've done it. Power dropping. Get out before it blows.</t>
 <t id="800327">Just go.</t>
 <t id="800328">For Earth.</t>
 <t id="800340">He's changed the wormhole. We've lost Earth.</t>
 <t id="800342">The station's coming apart, it's going to break up...</t>

 <t id="908219">My life is in your hands.</t>
 <t id="908220">Those that look with closed eyes cannot see. Leave me.</t>
 <t id="908221">I'm sorry, Brennansama, I can't help you.</t>
 <t id="908406">Who else could I go to?. When the wise fail to find the truth, sometimes you must seek a fool.</t>
 <t id="908407">I know very little. He showed me the plans of the projector and I saw that I could find Earth. He said he wanted the truth to be known, that the ancients had made a mistake in shutting the races off. That the Earth had been lost by accident and fate must now return it to its proper place.</t>
 <t id="908408">I have told you what I know. It is an energy vortex from which the jump events are created. This must be the last of them in our space.</t>

 <t id="911431401">Thanks for your help, JB. Ban Danna's asked me to collect your spydrones. I'll pick them up and meet you in Ocracoke's storm.</t>
 <t id="911460101">JB, still nothing on the ship. Аргон security thinks it could be from a race called the Sohnen. They were around when the old ones built the gates. No one knows much about them, but it's a lead and it does tie in with those crystals being from the ancients. Still, as it doesn't appear in the junior book of starship spotting it could be anything. I'll pick up your co-ordinates and come out to you, see if we can find out why this ship keeps turning up.</t>
 <t id="911460501">I've got nothing so far. You'd better check at the Гордість Турука trading station.</t>
 <t id="911460801">I've got a lead, JB. Miria went to the Silicon Mine. The base manager there works for the Don. Maybe they can tell us what happened to her. Meet me there.</t>
 <t id="911461301">Where are you, JB? I think I'm being followed and I need you here to back me up. Get your thrusters back to Прибуток Теладі and cover me.</t>
 <t id="911462001">Where are you, JB? I need that distraction. You're going to have to get rid of those squash mines!</t>
 <t id="911462401">I think I know where Miria is, but there are a lot of guards. I'll need you to get me out of here as soon as I find her.</t>
 <t id="911463101">I'm not hanging about here on my own. I'll be on the Trading Station in Прибуток Теладі. Let me know when you can spare the time to join me.</t>
 <t id="911463201">Come on, JB, the only lead we've got is the Don's daughter. Meet me on the Trading Station in Прибуток Теладі and let's find out what's going on.</t>
 <t id="911464101">I'm taking Miria back to Легенда Фарнгама, meet me there as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="911464102">I've got Miria back to Легенда Фарнгама, meet me here and we'll get the information we need from the Don.</t>
 <t id="912410102">Thomus is, well, he is rather a recluse. However, there is a friend of Thomus's on the Trading Station in Freedom's Reach, we'll have to talk to him to find out where Thomus is.</t>
 <t id="912410201">Brennansama, I am at the trading station in sector Freedom's Reach. Meet me as soon as you can.</t>
 <t id="912410401">I have docked at the Trading station, please join me there.</t>
 <t id="912410801">Brennansama, I am waiting with Geb at the Freedom's Reach Trading Station. Please come soon, we need to find Thomus quickly if we are to catch Ion.</t>
 <t id="912420301">We must get to Ban Danna as quickly as possible Brennansama. I'm worried about Thomus. I'll meet you by Аргон One in Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="912420401">I'm waiting for you in Пояс Руди, we'll find Thomus as soon as you get here.</t>
 <t id="912431201">We should get to Ocracoke's Storm quickly, Brennansama. I fear for Thomus's safety if we're not there when he meets Ion.</t>

 <t id="500001">I will contact Noah at the Гонер temple.</t>
 <t id="500002">Everything is being prepared. I will come back later when the fleet is ready.</t>
 <t id="510001">I have to get in touch with Armanckessilon. He is in Паранід Прайм, which is closed to every non-Паранід at the moment. But still I'll have to try to get there.</t>
 <t id="510002">I will go to Імператорські Шахти where I will contact Nolman on the trading station.</t>
 <t id="510003">Nolman will contact me with further information.</t>
 <t id="510004">Armanckessilon will meet me in Elena's Fortune.</t>
 <t id="510005">I need to raise the money for Nolman.</t>
 <t id="510006">I still haven't got enough money for Nolman.</t>
 <t id="520001">The black crystal should be near the shipwreck in the Ксенонський Сектор 101. I need to get it.</t>
 <t id="530001">I've got to check out the disruptor factory in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530002">I will meet Miria in Зрада Бала Гі. She's got a contact that can help us with the Yaki station, but I will need 10.000 credits worth of computer components.</t>
 <t id="530003">I need to scan the station in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530004">I should contact Ban Danna. He's at the Аргон One in Аргон Prime.</t>
 <t id="119540001">Julian, could you meet me onboard Аргон One? I've heard you might have plans of those Yaki missiles and I'd like to see them.</t>
 <t id="119540101">Julian, could you please meet me on board Аргон One?</t>
 <t id="421512001">I await you in Elena's Fortune lower being. If you seek trade bring the credits quickly my patience with you is limited.</t>
 <t id="421512801">If lower life form still needs crystal, Armanckessilon will trade, but due to your stupidity, price is now %d credits.</t>
 <t id="422511702">Insignificant ones, Armanckessilon is willing to associate with your pitiful selves. He will meet you at Elena's Fortune and demands %d credits for the crystal you seek.</t>
 <t id="815500401">Okay, you want a list of the places my contacts found, you got it.</t>
 <t id="815500402">Some Паранід clown called Armanckessilon got the Blue Sculpt crystal you want, that mean you and the Yaki got big problems. This Armanckessilon's in Паранід Прайм and them no-carra Paranids got their central sectors shut tighter than a Теладі's moneybag. They got heavy cruisers blasting any non-Paranids that come in. I hope they shove the Yaki's thruster pipes up their Bastu, but you, you got to find a way to contact this Паранід baka.</t>
 <t id="815500403">The other crystal they after is the Black Crystal. Catchy. Last anyone heard it was on some Ксенон M0. Lucky for you it got fragged a few years ago in Меморіал Нопілео. The Ксенон towed it to Ксенонський Сектор 101. Them Yaki tried to get it, but got beat up bad. Whatever those slugtuggers want these crystals for, they want them a lot. I hope the Ксенон bury them all.</t>
 <t id="815500404">That Yaki disruptor factory, they got it in Olmancketslat's Treaty. They got a lot of firepower around it, and those disruptor missiles. You want their secret, you gonna need a clever way of getting to it. You ask Miria. She's good at a clever.</t>
 <t id="815500405">And you better look after her, she break a nail, you so much as breathe on her and you'll find it hard to fly with no joystick, you know what I mean.</t>
 <t id="816500001">I am ready, so you meet me at my poppa's place in Легенда Фарнгама and we'll hunt Yaki.</t>
 <t id="816500101">Where are you, JB? I am at my poppa's place in Легенда Фарнгама with the information you need and I don't like to be kept waiting!</t>
 <t id="816510901">I got a better idea, get out of there, JB, or you want to be a dead Baka?</t>
 <t id="816510902">What are you doing JB? Get out of there and go meet my contact.</t>
 <t id="816511201">Trading station, Імператорські Шахти. That remind you of anything? Because that's where I am and I'm getting very bored here on my own.</t>
 <t id="816511601">Have you got the credits yet? I've tried my other contacts, but Nolmancketnun is the only one willing to help. We should get back to him with the credits before he changes his mind.</t>
 <t id="816512701">Where are you JB? Armanckessilon's still in Sector Elena's Fortune and we have to get that crystal of him. You want those rectemite Yaki to get it?</t>
 <t id="816530601">Meet me on the Quantum Tube Fab in Зрада Бала Гі and hurry it up, JB.</t>
 <t id="911550320">Ion got away, but we still have the crystals. Thomus thinks Ion is desperate enough to try again. Come and meet us back at Пояс Руди and let's see if we can get him this time.</t>
 <t id="911550701">JB?! Where are you? We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the Yaki stealing the crystals.</t>
 <t id="911551101">I thought you wanted to be here when we captured Ion. Meet us by the West Gate in Пояс Руди as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="911551102">This was your idea, JB! Get yourself to the West Gate in Пояс Руди now!</t>
 <t id="912550101">Please meet me at the Temple, Brennansama. Thomus and Saya are here and we need to decide what to do about Ion.</t>
 <t id="912550901">Brennansama, we have assembled the fleet you suggested and Thomus is making contact with Ion. Please return to the temple as soon as you can.</t>

 <t id="600010">I should go contact Nolman on the trading station in Імператорські Шахти and see if he can arrange to have the mine built.</t>
 <t id="422610401">Inferior lifebeing, I have estimated the cost for building an Ore Mine at the specified location. I demand a total of %d Credits. Contact me at the trading station in Імператорські Шахти when you have the money.</t>
 <t id="422610701">Lowerlife, I have made arrangements for your sorry carcass to be allowed access to our glorious space. Meet me at the trading station in Імператорські Шахти to discuss the details.</t>
 <t id="424611202">Your mine has been constructed and we have begun the mining operation.</t>
 <t id="424611301">The mining is proceeding on course. Nolmancketnun has asked me to order lowerlife to return to the mine immediately so that they may witness Nolmancketnun's success.</t>
 <t id="424611302">Unholy one, I have been assigned the task of helping your pitiful self by overseeing the mining procedure. We are currently loading the Mine onto our ship in Паранід Прайм and shall leave for the specified destination shortly.</t>
 <t id="427611901">By order of his magnificence the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, all Паранід installations are closed to non-Paranids. Do Not Attempt to Dock. No Further Communication is desired.</t>
 <t id="911610201">I thought we were going to Імператорські Шахти to meet your contact? So, where are you heading, JB?</t>
 <t id="911610601">How are you doing with the credits? %d thousand's a lot to find, so remember to check behind the padding on your flightseat and in the pockets of your dirty flightsuits. I'm having a lot of fun on the station in Імператорські Шахти. You know once you get to know them some Паранід have got a wicked sense of humour.</t>
 <t id="911611011">I'm at the mine in Кола Жреця . Nolman did a good job with it and it's operational. I'll meet you here.</t>
 <t id="911611201">They're getting close to breaking through, you got that factory ready?</t>
 <t id="911611202">Your mine has been constructed and we have begun the mining operation.</t>
 <t id="911611701">The Паранід are starting to ask questions about the Seed, JB, the sooner you get that crystal Fab here and we can leave, the better.</t>
 <t id="911611702">Do you have the Seed, JB? You'd better not forget about me, I'm still on the Trading Dock in Імператорські Шахти. Pick me up when you have the Seed.</t>
 <t id="912610004">Ion says the Seed can be found inside an asteroid in Кола Жреця . However, as the Паранід borders are still closed, only Паранід can build mines there. You'll have to find a way to persuade someone to help you.</t>
 <t id="912610005">Once you have, you will need to build a super-factory, the details of which are attached to this message. All the information we have about the seed is that it is some sort of high energy vortex. A vortex powerful enough to tear a hole in space, so be cautious!</t>
 <t id="912610006">Ion has given this information very easily and we know nothing of this creature who he claims tricked him, so be wary, Julian. I feel in my heart that this Sargon cannot be Sohnen, they were peaceful and there are no reports of them manipulating other races. May you tread the path of wisdom with your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="912612001">Brennansama, you must build the whole complex - [Add list of components here] on LSWM - 2610 an asteroid in Кола Жреця  to get the Seed that Sargon seeks. We must know what this thing is. All Ion knows is that it is some kind of energy hub, so please be careful with it. It contains great power.  Who knows, with your help we may discover a secret we have sought for centuries.</t>

 <t id="710010">Ban is preparing a ship for scanning the Паранід installations. He will contact me again when the ship is ready.</t>
 <t id="720010">Kyle is onboard the Аргон One in Аргон Prime. I should go talk to him and Ban Danna.</t>
 <t id="720020">We scanned the first installation but there were no traces of Nividium there. Next is the Nividium Processing Plant in Паранід Прайм.</t>
 <t id="720030">No Nividium in the second Plant, what did the Паранід do with it? We should go to Володіння Герцогу to check out the third one.</t>
 <t id="720040">I should return to Аргон Prime and talk to Ban Danna immediately.</t>
 <t id="750010">I've captured a Паранід Patrol Ship which enables me to actually see the cloaked station in Володіння Герцогу. Miria and I are trying to take down the cloak by destroying its generators.</t>
 <t id="119710004">Julian, I have news of your father. He regained consciousness during the Хаак attack on Аргон Prime, but before I could speak to him he stole a ship and left the station. His doctors have evidence that at the moment the Хаак arrived, his brainwaves matched the pattern of the Хаак jump events. I'm afraid word of this has got back to the senate. Senator McCarthy thinks he is being influenced by the Хаак and has ordered that Kyle must be found and, if he refuses to return, the search party has permission to fire on him.</t>
 <t id="119710005">I can't delay the search fleet forever, but I can give you a headstart. Before he went, your father looked up files on the AP Gunner. As you know he was looking for the Gunner before he disappeared, so I believe he's headed where you found it in Схованка Ньяни. We have to know what's important about that ship and what he discovered about the Хаак.</t>
 <t id="119710006">Find him and bring him home safe, Julian. I can't believe your father would betray us.</t>
 <t id="119710201">I will have to pass this information on to Аргон Central very soon. Find him fast, Julian.</t>
 <t id="119711001">The search fleet is on its way. They know where Kyle was headed. You must intercept him before they do.</t>
 <t id="119720001">Eagle Flight notified me that they linked up with you. I'm glad to hear Kyle is well. Please return to Аргон One as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119720101">Your father has returned to Аргон One with some very important information. Based on this I have an urgent mission for you. Please return to Аргон One as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119720232">Julian. The ship is ready. Please return to Аргон One.</t>
 <t id="119722801">Julian, please return to Аргон One immediately. There have been some developments.</t>
 <t id="119722901">Julian, please return to Аргон One immediately. The Паранід Empire has declared you a criminal for the murder of Armanckessilon and for the theft of the Seed. It looks like Аргон will also agree to declare you a criminal. You need to return here as soon as possible so we can sort this out.</t>
 <t id="119723001">Julian, the Аргон Senate has voted to declare you a criminal. Your assets have been frozen and if you do not return immediately, then steps will be taken to bring you to justice. You must return as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119723301">Julian, I have an idea how we can sort this whole mess out. Please return to Аргон One now.</t>
 <t id="119730701">Julian, I've had to use secure channels to send you this message. The senate have now declared you renegade, so you'll have to stay out of sight of Аргон and Паранід installations. Both governments are talking to the other races and it won't be long before at least the Boron also declare you renegade. The only way out of this is for you to find out what the Паранід are doing and why.</t>
 <t id="119730702">Hopefully, by now you've met up with the Don. He'll help you get what you need. I think your instincts about a cloaking device are correct. It's not something we've been able to achieve, but there have been rumours of the Паранід succeeding. We'd been wondering how they managed it and you're right, the probability is it was with help from this alien 'Sargon'. The question is - why Sargon suddenly chose to stop working with the Паранід and go to Ion instead.</t>
 <t id="119730703">However they built the cloaking device, it will have been expensive and it will require huge amounts of energy to maintain, so whatever they are doing it must be worth a lot to them.</t>
 <t id="119730704">By the way, the senate has also insisted that we return the Seed. The Паранід are sending a convoy to pick it up.</t>
 <t id="119730705">Find out what they're doing, Julian and come back when you can prove it. Good luck!</t>
 <t id="815730801">You wise up and realise you need our help, you find us in Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="815731001">I better warn you, the Аргон authorities they got a lead on you. They're checking your false ID after it was registered somewhere. As soon as they crack it they be after you, so you better get your space cadet bastu to my base in Легенда Фарнгама!</t>
 <t id="815751201">You want to make more enemies? That's my jumpship and I want it back you piece of crazola.</t>
 <t id="816740304">You forgotten you a wanted man? You forgotten everyone trying to kill you? Get your bastu back here, JB.</t>
 <t id="816740305">We in Кола Жреця . You want us to bring you a souvenir, or are you going to get your lousy carras back into this sector?</t>
 <t id="816750101">You want a jump drive, or not? Meet me at home in Легенда Фарнгама.</t>
 <t id="816750601">Where you go, JB? We have to try to uncloak this station, it's the only thing we can do to find anything out at the moment. Get your bastu back to Володіння Герцогу right now!</t>
 <t id="816750701">We're in sector Heretic's End you better catch up with us as soon as you can, JB.</t>
 <t id="816760002">We're out on the 'East'side of Heretic's End. You gotta see this, JB.</t>
 <t id="911720401">You could've installed some more leisure stuff on this ship, JB. I'm getting really bored. In short, GET YOUR BASTU BACK HERE AND PICK ME UP!</t>
 <t id="911722701">Well, thanks for the excitement, JB. Great day out almost getting killed, then ditched for another ship - thanks. Wise up, get back here and let's get back to Ban Danna!</t>
 <t id="911722702">I've taken the ship and headed back to Аргон One. Meet me back there as soon as you can and, oh, better bring some credits, you owe me at least a drink!</t>
 <t id="911723401">We need to head for Імператорські Шахти, I think that's the best place to start, I'll give you more information once we get there. I've had a look at this equipment...they must be stretched at Аргон command - it's ancient! We're going to have to get close to whatever we scan to get any readings.</t>

 <t id="6513">Rapier Missile</t>
 <t id="6514">Fresh from the drawing boards of the Аргон Military Research Labs, the Rapier missile can acquire and lock down targets at speed, launching a devastating albeit relatively weak attack against an enemy vessel, far faster than many pilots reflexes. Used in close-range combat, often in numbers, as well as through medium range evasive routines, this device is considered to be an essential backup to any standard array of laser weaponry. </t>
 <t id="6519">There is no description available for this missile in the ship computer database.</t>
 <t id="6523">Firelance Missile</t>
 <t id="6524">The Firelance Missile was developed by the Паранід Military, however this missile was phased out of service. Some stockpiles were not accounted for after decommissioning, and have yet to be found.</t>
 <t id="6533">Wildfire Missile</t>
 <t id="6534">The Wildfire missile is a prototype missile developed by the Industritech Corporation before the Хаак attacks. However a production stage has not yet been reached. Some missiles have reportedly gone missing, but official sources have denied that this is the case.</t>
 <t id="6543">Windstalker Missile</t>
 <t id="6544">One of the most powerful missiles in the synaptic range, the Windstalker has been proven to bring an edge to any combat pilot's weapons portfolio. Good speed and yield make this missile a wise choice for attack runs and interception of mid-range craft. Where covert operations without scanner use are required, the Windstalker is unsurpassed. </t>
 <t id="6553">Banshee Missile</t>
 <t id="6554">A powerful military-grade medium range image-recognition missile, the Banshee offers pilots the chance to show their enemies the true meaning of fear. While not the fastest missile available, its yield and strong acquisition ability allow it to be used in a wide range of combat scenarios against medium to heavy fighters. </t>
 <t id="6563">Beluga Missile</t>
 <t id="6564">This is the popular Terran missile called the Beluga. It is the standard earth fleet missile used onboard fighter craft.</t>
 <t id="6573">Hammerhead Missile</t>
 <t id="6574">The Hammerhead is the Terran heavy assault missile commonly used on Earth Fleet capital ships.</t>

 <t id="6713">Repair Laser</t>
 <t id="6714">This weapon is installed on repair drones to assist in the welding of new Teladianium Panelling to stations if they need to be repaired.</t>
 <t id="6731">Firefly Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6732">This factory produces the Firefly Missile. A standard dumbfire missile.</t>
 <t id="6733">Firefly Missile</t>
 <t id="6734">With combat increasingly being fought at ever closer range, Аргон Military specialists turned to the development of a more straightforward technology that did not require the advanced guidance systems of other missile units. The result was the Firefly Missile, a small, extremely fast projectile. With a high exit velocity and single trajectory, it is a one shot one chance armament.</t>
 <t id="6741">Thunderbolt Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6742">This factory produces the Thunderbolt Missile. A Heat seeking armament that uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums.</t>
 <t id="6743">Thunderbolt Missile</t>
 <t id="6744">The Thunderbolt Heatseeker Missile uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums. Doing so allows it to track targets in areas where doing so would otherwise be impossible. Classically used when engaging multiple targets at distance, though pilots have since found other more ingenious uses for them.</t>
 <t id="6751">Tempest Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6752">This factory produces the Tempest Missile. A Friend/Foe armament that will target its nearest enemy and change its target if the initial target is lost.</t>
 <t id="6753">Tempest Missile</t>
 <t id="6754">Dependent on the ship computer of the vessel it was launched on, the Tempest Missile scans for enemy targets and establishes priority of attack. In doing so, if the primary target is lost, it will immediately lock down the secondary, and so on, until it either runs out of fuel, or makes contact.</t>
 <t id="6761">Hurricane Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6762">This factory produces the Hurricane Missile. A Proximity Charge device that will explode when near to your target, causing area-wide damage.</t>
 <t id="6763">Hurricane Missile</t>
 <t id="6764">After some concern that this armament would be nothing more than a continuation of the SQUASH Mine's unethical usage, the Hurricane Missile firmly routed itself in military circles as being the weapon-of-choice when dealing with large numbers of small targets. Perfect for both Хаак cluster engagements as well as Pirate raid units.</t>
 <t id="6771">Blizzard Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6772">This factory produces the Blizzard Missile. A tracker missile that splits into several independent units that will track separate enemies using your ship-computer's friend or foe signatures.</t>
 <t id="6773">Blizzard Missile</t>
 <t id="6774">The Blizzard Missile offers combatants the ability to effectively deal with multiple targets with the use of one missile. While not as powerful as a one-shot direct unit, the missile will Спліт into several independent components that will track separate enemies using your ship-computer's friend or foe signatures.</t>
 <t id="6781">Cyclone Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6782">This factory produces the Cyclone Missile. A Proximity Image Recognition missile.</t>
 <t id="6783">Cyclone Missile</t>
 <t id="6784">Similar to the Blizzard, the Cyclone Missile offers the same ability to deal with multiple targets with one armament. Again not as powerful as a one-shot direct unit, the missile will Спліт into several smaller units that will engage image recognition tracking to lock down confirmed enemies in the field of engagement.</t>
 <t id="6791">Tornado Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6792">This factory produces the Tornado Missile. A dumbfire swarm missile.</t>
 <t id="6793">Tornado Missile</t>
 <t id="6794">The Tornado Missile improves on the one-shot one-chance performance of the Firefly by overpowering the target with a swarm of missiles. Using an array of armaments, the Tornado is launched either simultaneously, or in swift succession, allowing the pilot to strafe the target with a battery of attacks.</t>
 <t id="6801">Typhoon Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6802">This factory produces the Typhoon Missile. A swarm missile that makes use of an Image Recognition system.</t>
 <t id="6803">Typhoon Missile</t>
 <t id="6804">Holding more accuracy than the Firefly, the Typhoon Missile again allows multiple armaments to be launched at the same target, however with the addition of Image Recognition tracking, the possibility of success has been raised substantially. Again launching simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.</t>
 <t id="6811">Firestorm Torpedo Factory</t>
 <t id="6812">This factory produces the Firestorm Torpedo. A high yield torpedo for use against capital ships and stations.</t>
 <t id="6813">Firestorm Torpedo</t>
 <t id="6814">One of the slowest and most powerful projectile weapons in the current batch of armaments used, the Firestorm Torpedo holds devastating destructive force at the expense of speed and manoeuvrability. While remarkably easy to shoot down, if successful, this weapon can yield great damage to a station, and in volume, even destroy it. Its success against large combat craft can be equally devastating when employed on close range attack runs.</t>
 <t id="6821">Aurora Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6822">This factory produces the Aurora Synaptic Missile. A new technology that allows detonation of the missile to be controlled by the pilot.</t>
 <t id="6823">Aurora Missile</t>
 <t id="6824">The Aurora is classed as a Synaptic Detonator missile, a new and revolutionary technology that allows the pilot to choose when to detonate his missile to the Спліт second of pressing the trigger. The pilot first fires his missile and then uses the fire missile trigger again to detonate the missile before the onboard timer expires.</t>
 <t id="6831">Remote Guided Warhead Factory</t>
 <t id="6832">This factory produces the remote guided warhead.</t>
 <t id="6833">Remote Guided Warhead</t>
 <t id="6834">The Remote Guided Warhead is designed to be part missile and part drone. It is fired normally however the pilot can take remote control to position the missile into an accurate firing line.</t>
 <t id="6841">Wasp Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6842">This factory produces the Wasp Missile. A swarm missile that makes use of an Image Recognition system.</t>
 <t id="6843">Wasp Missile</t>
 <t id="6844">The Wasp Missile was remodelled for use against the Хаак and was the prototype for the Swarm Image Recognition tracking. Launching missiles simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.</t>
 <t id="6851">Dragonfly Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6852">This factory produces the Dragonfly Missile. A standard dumbfire missile.</t>
 <t id="6853">Dragonfly Missile</t>
 <t id="6854">Before developing the Firefly missile, the Аргон Military refitted the Dragonfly missile with dumbfire protocols to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing. The dumbfire Dragonfly replaces the now obsolete original. It continues in service to this day.</t>
 <t id="6991">Ranger</t>
 <t id="6992">The Гонер Ranger is one of few ships known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the Goners this ship holds no weaponry. The Ranger is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters. You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and R.Gunne.</t>
 <t id="7001">Eclipse</t>
 <t id="7002">The Federal Аргон Government commissioned Bala Gi Research Inc. to develop a heavy fighter, larger than the current Nova, to fulfil a wider range of roles. The result, the Eclipse, enjoys a larger cargo bay than the Nova, at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability.  The Аргон military are glad to welcome this craft to their arsenal, with some suggestion that a missile gunboat role may emerge for the Eclipse.</t>
 <t id="7011">Chimera</t>
 <t id="7012">The Спліт Chimera was developed by Bala Gi Research Inc. following a successful tender to produce a ship that gave better long-range performance over the Mamba. Спліт defence experts view the Chimera as a logical step to delivering a heavy fighter with enhanced load-carrying capability and endurance.</t>
 <t id="7021">Medusa</t>
 <t id="7022">The Паранід government, learning that Bala Gi Research Inc. was to develop enhanced heavy fighters for other races, asked the company to investigate new design options for a heavy fighter to provide load-carrying capacity enhancements over the Perseus. The Medusa was the result. This new design fills a number of capability gaps that exist within the Паранід fleet.</t>
 <t id="7031">LX</t>
 <t id="7032">Pilots brave enough to traverse Ксенон space in recent mozuras have reported sighting a strange ship, larger than a Ксенон L.  Defence experts have named it the LX.  The ship, appearing larger than its Ксенон L counterpart, is assumed to have a larger cargo capacity, while being only marginally less swift and agile.</t>
 <t id="7041">Hyperion</t>
 <t id="7042">Once owned by the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia and sailed under the name 'Trinity', this unique vessel was a prototype for a new M7 class of ship.  The contract for the serial production of the ship was cancelled for financial reasons when the Паранід Defence Directorate decided to divert funds to its secret jumpgate project. The ship's awesome capabilities place it between an M6 and an M2-class vessel, it's astounding design the ultimate in Паранід innovation.</t>

 <t id="30000">Ruined by dreams of avarice, this sector was originally claimed by a Теладі entrepreneur, eager to expand to ever greater frontiers. But within his investments at Grand Exchange lay the seeds of despair that eventually led to this sector being placed under auction, in the hope that salvation would be financial, if nothing more.</t>
 <t id="30001">Whether this sector was claimed through fate or fortune is still Невідомий. However rumour persists that the owner, of distant descent, came to its ownership through a journey many believed existed only in myth and legend. The future has yet to be written, but its foundations begin and end here, within these gates.</t>

 <t id="1030504">After the Хаак attack on President's End, a decision was made to improve the security of Аргон home systems. A taskforce was assembled in Стіна and sent to Elena's Fortune. Orders were given to capture and retake the sector, after a Хаак attack decimated the pirate forces who had held control over the system for so long. Аргон surveillance expeditions later discovered that the Хаак attack destroyed the gate leading to the neighbouring system of Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="1030514">Discovered and claimed by the Паранід, Heretic's End was abandoned due to its distance from the rest of the Паранід Empire. Today it is used as a training area for Паранід pilots.</t>
 <t id="1030615">Гонер prophets and mystics, their mission now complete, travel along a very different path to that of their forefathers. The burning prophecy that Nathan R Gunne's words once held is embodied in this sector, now home to an ever-increasing number of believers, intent on ensuring that the truth of Gunne's Crusade lives on in eternity. To that end, each new station is blessed and considered a distant annexe of the Гонер Temple.</t>
 <t id="1030619">After a failed attempt at securing land from the Njy family, the Z'rt family had no choice but to look elsewhere. Rumours emerged over time that the Ryk family had discovered a new system which they were soon planning to occupy. However because of a lack of resources they kept such knowledge a closely guarded secret, - or so they thought. Acting upon data collected from their spies, the Z'rt family moved in quickly and established a colony, much to the Ryk family's anger.</t>
 <t id="1030620">After establishing their primary system to the anger of the Ryk family, the Z'rt patriarch gained the friendship of the Njy family and secured resources to establish their second system. Z'rt's Dominion was formed bordering a dangerous Ксенон system.</t>
 <t id="1030621">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030720">This newly discovered system shows that the Ксенон are still a concern; the sector houses a secondary production facility for Ксенон vessels and is home to a large defence force. Some speculate that a Ксенон core system is nearby.</t>
 <t id="1030801">Increased Хаак activity has meant that the Паранід have made no move to reclaim this inhospitable sector and no other race has shown interest as it borders only Паранід space. Localised Yaki activity is also a negative point to consider, leading some to believe it is used as a Pirate or Yaki safe-haven.</t>
 <t id="1030805">Ex-racing pilot and wealthy entrepreneur, Ser Alman Jonferson used some of his vast financial fortune to help sponsor construction on one of the largest and most prestigious racing circuits available. Its proximity to the lawless pirate sectors does however make security in this sector an issue. Race events held here do make for some of the most interesting races in the league calendar.</t>
 <t id="1030806">After the battle in the sector known today as Меморіал Нопілео, the Ксенон have used this sector as a junkyard, storing and recycling ships here. The coordinates for the gate to this sector were lost, but a recent survey by Аргон Expeditionary forces have since rediscovered the gate's location.</t>
 <t id="1030818">Midnight Star was discovered by Аргон Expeditionary Forces and named because of the angle at which the now colonised planet faces the sun, leaving one hemisphere in eternal night time.</t>
 <t id="1030819">This sector was established shortly after the initial Хаак invasions, and was intended as a support sector for supplying food and minerals to other Аргон colonies.</t>
 <t id="1030820">The Grand Exchange refers to the large skyscraper on the surface of Goldminer's Dream, the primary planet. The traders' exchange centre was supposed to control Теладі Company trade throughout the known universe. However the Хаак attacks on Теладі communications satellites stopped the necessary communications.</t>
 <t id="1030901">This bleak region is home to the Yaki faction. Little else is known about this sector.</t>
 <t id="1030909">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030920">Merchant Haven was established to be a major trade port for the new Теладі expansion campaign. However the plans failed when surprise attacks by hostile forces stopped the advance into nearby systems. The sector now serves the local Теладі population and trades with the nearby Аргон and Спліт.</t>
 <t id="1031001">Mired in the torment of a war without honour, rumour suggests the Yaki have chosen this sector as a point of respite and for many of them, a place to call home.  Аргон and Паранід scouts returning from missions have reported ships known to be of Yaki origin, patrolling both this and the adjacent sector of Ocracoke's Storm.  Clearly both sectors offer a battlefront upon which to launch further attacks, while protecting the dark secrets thought to dwell deep within the Badlands. The sector's name is a clear sign of defiance to the Аргон and a warning of past mistakes for the Теладі.</t>
 <t id="1031019">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031020">The Теладі discovered this sector shortly after they occupied the neighbouring Merchant Haven system. A strong magnetic storm blocked their sensors and a fleet of pirate vessels ambushed the explorers and destroyed their vessels. The Теладі have not returned.</t>
 <t id="1031119">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031202">The leader of the Спліт family Rhy discovered and occupied this sector shortly after the Хаак invasions began. The sector was supposedly taken from the Хаак by the Rhy Family in an unconfirmed story.</t>
 <t id="1031502">The Boron sector of Shining Currents was founded as a food production centre to aid the continuing growth of the Boron Kingdom. The name comes from the reflection of the mercury ocean on the moon of the primary planet.</t>
 <t id="1031512">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031603">The planet Elysium is described as a peaceful paradise world filled with lush plant life. The lowlands, however, are filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day. This does not seem to worry the Boron, who remain at some distance within their deep-sea homes.</t>
 <t id="1031608">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031609">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonists of not following the Паранід religion.</t>
 <t id="1031610">The fire pits of the planet of XaarXen were deemed to be holy by the priests of the Паранід Xaarist religion, after the original expedition vessel was consumed by a firestorm that formed from one of these pits.</t>

 <t id="10102">$AUTHOR$, Field Reporter, GalNet Economic News</t>
 <t id="10200">Check back regularly for all the latest business news concerning $SECTOR$ and surrounding areas. </t>
 <t id="10300">Surrounding sectors have reported a frenzied increase in traffic as ships struggle to reach $SECTOR$ to take advantage of the great prices. </t>
 <t id="10301">These events have given cause for many to believe that this may herald a new era for trade relations between $SECTOR$ and its neighbours. Those who believed otherwise appear to be in a now silent minority. </t>
 <t id="10302">Freighters are arriving at steadily increasing rates in the sector, loading up with as much stock as they can hold, with destinations as of yet Невідомий. Prices in neighbouring sectors remain steady despite the incredible offers currently available in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10303">While rumours of anything from a new Ксенон war to discovery of new sectors has fuelled the success of the economy in $SECTOR$, we cannot help but think that there has to be something more mundane behind the situation that has arisen here. Supply and demand perhaps? </t>
 <t id="10304">With the demand for wares now falling steadily, both local and free traders are now taking advantage of declining prices. Profits have never been so good for those in $SECTOR$ who own a freighter and a pilot's licence. </t>
 <t id="10305">With prices having fallen to such a degree, Sector Patrols have noticed a marked decrease in pirate attacks as even known criminals decide that legally purchasing items would actually be cheaper than risking sector raids. </t>
 <t id="10400">There does not seem to be an end to the sector's good fortune, and while many may think that the profits made by those who trade in this area may be less than legal, nothing has been proven bar honest work and long stazuras spent in hangar bays and cockpits. </t>
 <t id="10401">We have seen countless traders spread across the sector who are clearly delighted at the turn of events to befall them. While many agree with us that these times will eventually come to an end, no one is willing to place a bet on when that time may come. </t>
 <t id="10402">Jumpgates remain in constant use as the sector works hard to process the traders working to cut a higher margin of profit on trades that are now becoming known across even more outlying regions. </t>
 <t id="10403">Having spent a considerable period of time with its people, we have seen a sector that has been transformed by the good fortune it has been struck by. Traders of all races have been happy to greet us, even talk for a while, and in this we have seen the true magic that profits can bring to a people, regardless of their origin in known space. </t>
 <t id="10404">After witnessing the good fortunes of many who pass through this sector, we have in turn decided to depart in search of further news to report to you, perhaps from those who have taken the profits they have made and turned them from dreams once cherished to reality. </t>
 <t id="10500">&quot;It's been incredible! I've never known anything like this to have happened before. Certainly my shipmates don't recall such an event in near history either!&quot; claimed $PERSON1$ who had just arrived at the station while we were investigating this story. </t>
 <t id="10501">&quot;I didn't think I would see something like this in my lifetime. I remember our elders talking of times like these when I was very young. That they are upon us now, this surprises me,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a station manager still apparently in shock at being in the middle of such happenings. </t>
 <t id="10502">&quot;We have seen so many workers who were clearly short of sleep and in need of replacement that we have stopped counting. The stress of the situation is indeed beginning to show, but one thing's for sure, profits have never been so good. We're selling like hellfire!&quot; said $PERSON1$, a station manager clearly excited to be seeing such incredible business. </t>
 <t id="10503">&quot;I'm thinking of taking the rest of the mazura off!&quot; This from $PERSON1$, a trader we managed to talk to before boarding a well-stocked freighter, &quot;I have enough credits profit to finally take the trip I've always wanted to. It's been a great time, I'm glad things are looking up for us here in $SECTOR$.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10504">&quot;There are few things I could think of that make more people smile than the sound of credits rolling into your account. This mazura has been good to us all. I only wish we had more times like now.&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, a wistful station manager aged beyond jazuras through constant struggle, yet finally knowing things had indeed been worthwhile. </t>
 <t id="10505">&quot;I haven't told my family yet,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a trader who was clearly unsure what to do with the additional profits made in the last few tazuras. &quot;I know I'll take them to Apoch's Argnuburgers, but beyond that, maybe we should save for times that are not as good as these.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10506">&quot;I've just finished loading up my freighter!&quot; gasped $PERSON1$, a pilot we managed to catch for a few words before departure. &quot;And you know what? It's full. And I don't mean half full, I mean full to capacity. I don't think I've ever been able to manage that before. My credits are certainly buying a great deal more than I remember!&quot; </t>
 <t id="10507">After watching several freighter pilots dock at stations in $SECTOR$, we picked one out who looked particularly joyous, and decided to ask her why. &quot;I talked to my partner today. I told him how many credits we'd made profit this mazura, and he started to weep with joy. It's not every tazura we make this kind of money, but when they come, we know our children will eat and out quarters will be warm. Simple things I know, but deep down, this is all that matters.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10508">&quot;I'm starting to think that maybe I have a chance to go to Combat Academy after all. I've made enough through trading this mazura to pay my way through for at least the first jazura. I really can't wait to get my own fighter ship!&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, a free trader who was offloading in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10509">&quot;I'm not sure whether this is good for the sector in general, but I'm sure it's doing a great deal more for our pockets. Profits have never been this good!&quot; said one free trader who had recently landed at a station in $SECTOR$ to load several ships to the bursting point with enough resources to stock a station for a wozura. </t>

 <t id="2010000">example of event 1 specific text</t>
 <t id="3010000">Solar Flares Spark Energy Boom in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3010100">A sudden rise in solar activity has enabled Solar Power Plants to substantially accelerate their production rate. Station managers across the sector have reported in record yields with prices dropping to an all-time low. This has in turn created a chain-reaction with other stations throughout the sector recording a surge in production. </t>
 <t id="3020000">Discovery in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3020100">Scientists have recently discovered another location for what may possibly be the first new resource to be of value in several Jazuras. Since the news was first published, $SECTOR$ has been flooded with requests for further information. While still Невідомий, it is believed the refinement of the resource yields massive amounts of energy cells, which has consequently sparked a rise in the production for all factories given the sudden abundance of energy now available for consumption in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="3030000">Asteroid Provides Minerals!</t>
 <t id="3030100">Traders from $SECTOR$ are still coming to terms with the good fortune caused by recent events, with many now unsure whether to remain resident within the region after making such high profits. A rapidly disintegrating asteroid has left a field of debris sector-wide late last tazura. Scans taken have shown the asteroid to have contained a large concentration of $WARE$. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are unable to confirm the vector of its approach or why they were unable to detect its arrival. Freighters have spent the last few stazuras collecting as much of the free $WARE$ as possible to sell on to already overflowing factories. </t>
 <t id="3040000">Stockpiles of $WARE$ Grow in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3040100">Manufacturers in $SECTOR$ have recently witnessed growing demand for the production of all wares. To compensate for this, stations have doubled shifts and drastically increased the amount of imported $WARE$ to ensure stock is kept in good supply. With the theory that it is better to have too much stock than none at all, turnover has reached unprecedented levels. Stations across the sector are experiencing surges in output due to the reduced downtime. </t>
 <t id="3050000">Apoch's ArgnuBurgers</t>
 <t id="3050100">The legendary cahoona burger merchants, Apoch's ArgnuBurgers, today suffered a setback when large volumes of cahoonas were marked as being unfit for the high quality required by the franchise and were returned to bakeries in $SECTOR$. While stocks of cahoonas returned for resale to less demanding customers have caused prices to plummet, Apoch's name still stands tall as a mark of true ArgnuBurger quality. </t>
 <t id="3060000">Record $WARE$ Output Predicted!</t>
 <t id="3060100">Station Owners in $SECTOR$ are preparing to line their pockets with credits after confirmation of an usually high output of $WARE$ for this season. Yields have been increased by up to 200% following an extended period of research by a group of $PEOPLE1$, who have yet to reveal or publish their scientific work formally. We have yet to confirm if the methods by which this boost has been gained are even legal in nature. </t>
 <t id="3070000">Markus Spaceflies Bring $SECTOR$ To Halt</t>
 <t id="3070100">Swarms of Markus spaceflies have recently caused problems for the $WARE$ industry in $SECTOR$, with stations seeing no more than half their original business levels. While the swarms have now dissipated, many pilots who work for the $WARE$ industry took time off to see and listen to the incredible sight of thousands of spaceflies moving in unison, and are now behind on their delivery schedules. Stocks are piling up with station managers dropping prices in an effort to lure buyers back in. </t>
 <t id="3080000">Production Booms For $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3080100">Stations producing $WARE$ in $SECTOR$ have dramatically ramped up production in an effort to ensure quotas are met before the end of the coming Mazura. Supplies of resources have remained steady with station owners even reportedly resorting to black market imports in order to keep production lines running.  Sharp investors will be able to make a higher than average margin while purchasing the surplus. </t>
 <t id="3090000">Sun Spots Spark Stockpiling in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3090100">A number of particularly large sun spots were noted on a star in the region of $SECTOR$ in the last mazura. These have inevitably brought more business to the sector, as travellers came to watch the stunning aurora scattered throughout the sector. With the expected surge in solar activity now almost at its end, radiation bursts are returning back to nominal levels. Having worked to increase productivity in an effort to meet the extra demand the event has caused, station managers selling $WARE$s are now left with a modest surplus of stock which is being sold at a discount. </t>

 <t id="10300">With distribution cycles now in disarray, $SECTOR$ has seen the largest single drop in wares since records began. It is still unclear how many stations have been affected. Reports are still being collated from all locations. </t>
 <t id="10301">It is now believed that the loss of goods will have a serious impact on all other stations in the sector. Free traders are asked to help ensure disruption is kept to a minimum. If you can help, jump to $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10302">Station owners have been rushing to us in the hope that we are able to offer support in this time of crisis, unfortunately all we could offer was a way to spread news of the plight many were now suffering. </t>
 <t id="10303">As we watched, ships from the far reaches of the galaxy were jumping in to offer support to those who were unable to deal with the crisis. Jostling for position in docking queues, some pilots were noticeably becoming quite agitated. </t>
 <t id="10304">Riots aboard a number of stations appear to have broken out, with local workers struggling to cope with the recent events that still appear to be unfolding before them. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are considering deploying additional patrols to the sector to prevent the unease from deteriorating into open combat. </t>
 <t id="10305">Many station owners have struggled to cope with the situation, unable to compensate for events they had never believed possible in such a secure area. TS Class vessels from a number of stations have been sent on long-distance missions in the hope that help will be received from friendly sectors further afield. </t>
 <t id="10306">Station owners have complained that they have not received adequate assistance from the $GOVERNMENT1$, who in their eyes, have had more than enough time to set up a plan to deal with the worsening events. </t>
 <t id="10307">An end to the current crisis is expected to be in sight. With many sectors now sending support and volunteers arriving in force to contribute to their aid, we hope those who have chosen to remain within $SECTOR$ will do so with peace of mind. </t>
 <t id="10308">While Sector Patrols have succeeded in maintaining peace in the area, there is still an air of unease surrounding the sector. Communications chatter remains subdued and tense. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have requested that any pilots willing to assist should jump to $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10309">This has led to a sector-wide shortfall in production, with demand growing higher for wares by the Stazura. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have been slow to respond, with no clear plan of action having ever been made for such an event. </t>
 <t id="10310">As prices continue to rise, with many freighters now leaving barely carrying any cargo at all, those remaining are struggling to keep $SECTOR$ functioning. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have several scout ships deployed to ensure shipping lanes are kept clear to allow for assistance to be delivered to affected stations quickly. </t>
 <t id="10311">Across $SECTOR$, stations have been reporting that production cycles have been delayed and in some cases halted altogether. The stocks of many stations have been seriously affected. </t>
 <t id="10312">Workers' families have been boarding Liners at every available station in an effort to vacate the sector. Stations which are now at the point of being unable to support or pay their own staff are clearly feeling the pressure of the rapidly worsening situation. </t>
 <t id="10313">Across $SECTOR$, stocks of wares have fallen markedly. Many stations have seen spates of panic-buying not seen since the arrival of the Хаак. Several station owners have elected to enlist the aid of friendly stations from other sectors in order to alleviate the stress of the current crisis. </t>
 <t id="10314">Workers in $SECTOR$ have struggled to make contact with family members in other sectors. With lines of communication overloaded, networks have been unable to cope with the sudden surge in data traffic following the events. Prices are now so high few can hope to fill more than a third of their transporters' cargo capacity. </t>
 <t id="10315">TP Liners have struggled to cope with demand as those dealing with the crisis have attempted to escape with their families, no longer feeling safe or at ease in $SECTOR$ despite assurances from the $GOVERNMENT1$. </t>
 <t id="10316">With many aspects of $SECTOR$ virtually grinding to a halt, free traders have become more apparent as freighters from outlying sectors arrive to provide what little help they may be able to offer in this current crisis. </t>
 <t id="10317">Sector Patrols have relaxed their routine scanning patrols in an effort to entice less than legal transports into the sector, hoping they may also carry much needed supplies to stations where they are urgently required. </t>
 <t id="10318">Additional Liners have been called in from nearby sectors to help with the crisis, as well as transport those now wishing to leave $SECTOR$ in search of somewhere more stable to settle their families. </t>
 <t id="10319">The $GOVERNMENT1$ have struggled to make contact with stations as communications systems and satellites failed to withstand the resulting traffic caused by the recent events. </t>
 <t id="10400">It is Невідомий how long the current state of affairs is expected to last, but while news of the unfortunate events still spreads across known space, ships will continue to flood in from other sectors. </t>
 <t id="10401">Пірат and other mercenaries have attacked a number of ships in an attempt to capitalise on an already weakened sector. Many pilots have turned back in fear of being unable to reach their destination without their ship being captured, or worse, their crew killed. </t>
 <t id="10402">Sector Patrols are estimating that the amount of patrols needed to ensure peace is upheld may need to be raised by a significant percent over the coming Mazura. It is only a matter of time before the $GOVERNMENT1$ either take control of the situation or allow it to develop into the worst crisis since the arrival of the Хаак. </t>
 <t id="10403">With so much upheaval in such a relatively short space of time, no one is sure whether we have yet to see the worst of this crisis. One can only hope an end is in sight. </t>
 <t id="10404">Restoration of services is expected to be completed within the next two wozuras. The doubt however remains that events such as these, while rare, will in time occur again. The only question is when. </t>
 <t id="10405">No one is certain yet what has caused the events we have described here. Superstitions still remain active, with some firmly believing the Ancients are punishing the sector for reasons only they know. </t>
 <t id="10406">Several stations have already begun preparing for what may well be a lengthy period of uncertainty. Non-essential staff have been relocated and families of crew transported to surrounding sectors. </t>
 <t id="10407">Inhabitants have been urged not to make any future travel plans or make journeys without prior authorisation from authorities unless absolutely essential. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are currently working hard to ensure the safety of all personnel and travellers within the sector. </t>
 <t id="10408">The $GOVERNMENT1$ have requested workers to remain calm during this stressful period. Additional Sector Patrols have been enlisted to cope with the additional demands from incoming traffic destined for stations inside the sector. </t>
 <t id="10409">No one knows how long the current crisis will continue, but it seems that regardless of species or location, times such as these befall all of us sooner or later. Many stations are now on high alert for further problems that may become apparent in the coming tazuras. </t>
 <t id="10410">The rumoured arrival of a strong military fleet has caused some concern amongst civilian inhabitants, with many feeling that the events that have taken place so far have yet to reach their peak. </t>
 <t id="10411">Friends and family of those within the sector are understandably concerned for their welfare given the sudden jump in market prices. Many believe they will no longer be able to afford the cost of supporting both themselves and those further afield. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have assured inhabitants that as soon as they have control of the crisis, and clear lines of command, normal operations will resume. </t>
 <t id="10412">It may be some time before the true nature of the events becomes clear. By that time though, it may be too late for those who suffer, perhaps in silence, within the sector. With credits running low, few are forecasting that the coming mazuras will be much better. </t>
 <t id="10413">It may be some time before the events unfolding in the sector can play out to their conclusion. While their outcome is unsure, what you can be sure of is that we will be there to ensure you receive the most up-to-date news possible. </t>
 <t id="10414">While no one has been openly pointing fingers at the $GOVERNMENT1$ yet, there still remains a group of people who believe that something could have been done to prevent the events that have shook the sector with such violence. </t>
 <t id="10415">With no clear sign that the current events are coming to an end, many workers are contemplating taking extended leave or relocating to sectors that do not seem to be as cursed as this one. </t>
 <t id="10416">It may be some time before the full extent of the losses are known, however we are already seeing a sector that is suffering both in the loss of its people's livelihoods, and to a lesser extent the loss of its productivity. </t>
 <t id="10500">One trader, $PERSON1$, spoke to us of his worries, &quot;how will we ever know our families are safe and secure while we are away? I have lost more than my livelihood today, I have lost my peace of mind concerning those who are near to me, the people I love.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10501">&quot;We're having to do everything we can to make sure everyone who has been affected is not left without support,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a busy Station Manager, &quot;but it's not like we mind, this affects us all.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10502">One worker aboard the station we visited was clearly concerned. &quot;We're not sure how long this is going to last or whether our future is secure. What will I tell my family?&quot; </t>
 <t id="10503">&quot;It's crazy!&quot; said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager we contacted at the main Trade Station. &quot;We don't have the resources to cope with this kind of crisis! I don't know how long it's going to be before someone takes control of the situation! Whether I'll be here when that happens I'm not sure.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10504">&quot;We just don't want to take the risk anymore! We keep hearing bad rumours about this sector, and in space a rumour is as good as the truth,&quot; said one freighter captain who was unwilling to be named. </t>
 <t id="10505">&quot;I don't think this could be any worse,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager struggling to come to terms with the enormity of the disaster. &quot;I have lost several of my crew, including their families, they've worked for us for so long and now we can't even afford to pay them.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10506">&quot;I didn't know what to do when I heard the news come through! All I could do was try and sell as much of my freight as people would take. I kept wondering whether my family would be able to eat with fewer credits coming in. Thankfully they will.&quot; This from $PERSON1$, a clearly relieved pilot who had only just docked in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10507">&quot;Look around you. We're all but dead in the water here. If we don't leave and find work elsewhere, our families will starve.&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, a distraught worker who was preparing to leave on the next TP Liner as we spoke. &quot;I don't know where we'll go, but anywhere is better than here right now.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10508">&quot;I can't keep up with this! I don't know what's going to happen next but I'm not sure I want to be here when it does. All I want is somewhere quiet and safe to keep my family, somewhere I don't have to worry about things like this,&quot; mentioned $PERSON1$, a pilot who clearly needed both a wash and some recovery time. </t>
 <t id="10509">&quot;I'm okay and I think my job's secure for now, but my family lives several sectors away. They don't know what's going on and I can't get through to them to tell them. Would you pass this message on to them?&quot; said $PERSON1$, who spoke to us before having to return to work. We have of course passed on his personal transmission. </t>
 <t id="10510">&quot;I'm not sure what's in store for us next. What I do know is that I'm ready and my family are safe and will be provided for. That's really all that matters to me,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager who had just completed stocking the cargo bays with enough resources to last through the Mazura. </t>
 <t id="10511">&quot;We didn't think it would be a good idea if we stayed. So we packed what we had and grabbed the next transport that arrived. Looking back, I think we did the right thing,&quot; said the father of one family who was clearly glad to have left when he did. </t>
 <t id="10512">&quot;I've already lost half of my profits from this mazura, I'm not willing to risk any more, and certainly not the security of my family or workers. We'll run at half capacity until we're sure this is all over,&quot; said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager who was clearly unhappy about the situation. </t>
 <t id="10513">&quot;I moved here because I thought we were safe from these kinds of events. Thinking back, perhaps we would have been safer where we were. You can never truly escape incidents such as these. So much has been lost here, so many hurt.&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, who was preparing to board a Liner with what remained of his family. &quot;My wife, I don't know where she is. Someone said she had already left. But where I don't know.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10514">&quot;I've seen some horrific things, like the Noodle Uprising of 762, but this just beats them all,&quot; rambled $PERSON1$, a well respected old-timer from the area. &quot;People are going to have nightmares about this one for jazuras, mark my words.&quot; </t>

 <t id="2010000">example of event 1 specific text</t>
 <t id="3010000">Solar Storm Damages Stations in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3010100">Solar storms have battered Solar Power Plants in $SECTOR$, damaging energy storage facilities as well as overloading internal station components. Many are now without adequate station management systems. At this time, virtually all of the Solar Power Plants in the sector are either down or producing at a substantially reduced rate. It will take some time before they are restored to normal operating status. </t>
 <t id="3020000">Defective Energy Cells Cripple $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3020100">In a staggering series of events, Station Managers in $SECTOR$ discovered to their complete dismay that over half of the stored Energy Cells in the sector were defective.  The source of the defective energy is unclear at this time, but Station Managers have agreed to meet to discuss possible changes to the obviously inadequate quality inspections that currently take place. The effect on the sector economy due to lost production time is projected to be catastrophic. </t>
 <t id="3030000">Miners Revolt in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3030100">Miners in $SECTOR$, upset about the latest disputes between union leaders and station owners, have finally taken to striking and even sabotaging quantities of produced $WARE$. Other stations in the sector are now experiencing difficulties due to the lack of useable $WARE$ to feed into production lines. It is not clear when a settlement will be reached with the rebellious miners, but many hope it will be before conditions degrade any further. </t>
 <t id="3040000">Resources Depleted, Sector In Shock</t>
 <t id="3040100">After an exceptionally busy period within $SECTOR$, Station Managers are finding their resources stretched to breaking point. While the root cause is still Невідомий, it is now apparent that a sector-wide shortage of $WARE$ now exists. Many stations are now turning to sectors several jumps away from their normal sources in the hope that the lack of resources will be relieved. </t>
 <t id="3050000">Parasites Consume $WARE$</t>
 <t id="3050100">Parasites have been detected in supplies of $WARE$ throughout $SECTOR$. Station Managers are livid at watching their stores literally eaten out from underneath them. Cleaning these parasites out has become a top priority for all concerned in the sector. In addition, the $GOVERNMENT1$ have confirmed that stores have fallen to such a degree that any free traders who are able to bring stocks of $WARE$ to the sector will be welcomed enthusiastically. </t>
 <t id="3060000">Famine in $SECTOR$, Assistance Urgently Required!</t>
 <t id="3060100">It is thought that close to 15% of the inhabitants of $SECTOR$ are malnourished or living in fear that remaining food supplies will soon disappear. With lack of support from the $GOVERNMENT1$ or the presence of free traders, the population of $SECTOR$ are unable to maintain anything more than a trickle of food stocks from outlying sectors. No significant supplies of $WARE$ have been seen for close to two Mazuras. We have registered consistently low levels of stock in all stations visited in the sector. </t>
 <t id="3070000">Strange Nebula Disrupts $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3070100">Scientists are completely baffled by a dramatic, short term increase in nebulae gas within $SECTOR$. With countless freighters and patrol craft unable to navigate effectively, shipping lines have been temporarily disrupted, and supplies of $WARE$ within stations seriously affected. A number of collisions have already been reported with some incidents between different races escalating to open combat. Station managers have reported rampant theft of remaining supplies as less than honest individuals take advantage of the confusion to try to acquire the $WARE$ by any means necessary. </t>
 <t id="3080000">Невідомий Virus Grips Inhabitants of $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3080100">Workers at stations producing $WARE$ within $SECTOR$ are reported to have been taken ill with what may possibly be the worst outbreak of Аргон Flu yet. Close to 450 workers have been affected at this time, with the number increasing as this news goes out. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are considering a quarantine for station workers until the source can be established. The origin of the outbreak has not yet been traced, but speculation is that something abnormal in the $WARE$ being produced is to blame. Further production has been temporarily halted until the source of the illness has been determined. </t>
 <t id="3090000">Explosions Rock $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3090100">Several explosions of Невідомий origin tore through $SECTOR$ late in the last tazura, throwing ships off course and causing minor damage to stations throughout the sector. The origin of the explosions is unclear, but it appears to be no coincidence that only stations storing $WARE$ were affected. Casualty figures appear to be negligible due to the improved storage bay shielding recently installed on all stations, but inhabitants are concerned that this might have been caused by a deliberately sabotaged shipment of wares and are suspicious that this may signal possible further attacks in the future. </t>
 <t id="3100000">Odnol Iralom Strikes Again</t>
 <t id="3100100">After a period of relative peace, it appears the notorious trickster Odnol Iralom has indeed struck again, this time in $SECTOR$ during the last tazura. Disguised as a simpleton with an infinite number of mundane questions, Iralom succeeded in keeping station managers so busy that several containers worth of $WARE$s were unloaded from cargo bays and removed without notice. Sector Patrols are currently searching for Odnol after being notified of the thefts by embarrassed and somewhat confused station workers, many unable to understand exactly what had happened. </t>

 <t id="10100">$AUTHOR$, Senior Хаак Analyst, GalNet News</t>
 <t id="10200">&quot;I don't want this to be the end of us. Not like this.&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$. &quot;My partner is working on another station, I know she's in just as much danger as I am, but that doesn't make it any better.&quot; $PERSON1$ was clearly concerned over the situation, refusing to continue work until the threat had been neutralised. </t>
 <t id="10201">Workers across $PEOPLE1$ sectors remain in peril as combat forces struggle to protect both freighters and stations from the threat of Хаак weapons technology. One worker, $PERSON1$, who looked particularly perturbed, took time out to say a few words to our reporter. &quot;I know they're doing their best out there, and I salute them, but I don't feel safe here on $THISSTATION$, I'd rather be much farther away. I wish they'd let us leave. I'd rather take my chances out there in my ship than stuck here sitting pretty.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10202">While reporting from $THISSTATION$, we managed to get a few words from the partner of a patrol fighter pilot of the $GOVERNMENT1$. &quot;It doesn't seem real. I mean I know he's out there, that he's fighting them off with the rest of our combat pilots. But when I look out there, I don't want to think of him not coming back to me. Why won't they just leave us alone? What do they want from us?&quot; We chose not to continue our report with her due to the evident strain the situation was causing. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected by the current conflict. </t>
 <t id="10203">&quot;I've never been this close to them. The sound they make, the way their weapons buzz. I don't like it.&quot; These words from $PERSON1$, the general manager of $THISSTATION$. Having halted production to allow for staff to be secured in areas that were away from possible impact points, the most he was able to do was stand and stare, silently praying that the sound and heat of Хаак firepower would not turn in our direction. &quot;We all seem to be at the mercy of the $GOVERNMENT1$'s Military forces, I hope this is a battle we can win.&quot; </t>
 <t id="10300">&quot;We did it! I can't believe we're still here to say that!&quot; These words from $PERSON1$ rang out amongst the cheers and adulation that filled $THISSTATION$ and countless others in the sector as news spread of the destruction of numerous Хаак vessels that had previously entered the area. With debris rapidly being cleared, a feeling of relief had spread like a wave as traders rushed to return to their normal routines. </t>
 <t id="10301">As word spread of the success of the mission against the Хаак incursion, $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$ shouted across to us his clear delight that we were all still alive. &quot;It's incredible! Did you see how they cut through those Хаак like they were bofu!? It's like we had some kind of new weapons technology or something, incredible I say!&quot; Regardless of the manner by which the Хаак were disposed of, the feeling of relief has indeed been overwhelming. </t>
 <t id="10302">&quot;He's coming back to me. I know he is. I just heard word that the last of the Хаак have been destroyed and that he was safe. I'm so glad to know this is all over.&quot; These words from a clearly relieved relative of one of the $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Forces pilots, who had engaged and held off Хаак vessels from attacking trade points until military units had been scrambled. There have been many acts of valour today, some will have gone unnoticed, but they have all counted towards a victory that will long be remembered. </t>

 <t id="2010000">Хаак Detected in $SECTOR1$!</t>
 <t id="2010100">We are currently working to confirm reports of Хаак activity in the sector of $SECTOR1$. $GOVERNMENT1$ patrols have spotted $NUMKHAAK$ in total at the time of this transmission. We ask all traders within this area to remain calm. Do not attempt to undertake journeys that may vector into Хаак spawn positions. Combat veterans are currently closing in on the Хаак positions, weapons-free and authorised to engage at will. Further updates will be made shortly. </t>
 <t id="2010101">A number of stations in $SECTOR1$ have transmitted urgent requests for assistance and protection following the appearance of Хаак vessels in their proximity. We urge all those who are in the area to remain calm. Patrols have been able to confirm the presence of $NUMKHAAK$ at the time of this transmission. Further updates will be made as and when we have more news. Military and combat units are on course to intercept and will engage shortly. </t>
 <t id="2010102">Combat awareness alerts have been issued for $SECTOR1$ following the detection of a number of Хаак vessels en route to coordinates well within the main trading matrix of that sector. Both free traders and military patrols have at this time marked a total of $NUMKHAAK$ on full thrust and vectoring for attack. All civilian craft are urged to take evasive action immediately and clear combat hotspots for military engagement. Updates on the situation will be made on further news from $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Units. </t>
 <t id="2020000">Victory Won Against Хаак Forces!</t>
 <t id="2020100">After a battle which ended with the loss of several combat veterans, it is now known that $KILLER$ launched a stunning attack run that resulted in the destruction of the Хаак vessel. While suffering major ship damage and plasma burns from ruptured thrust chambers, our hero still maintained course and launched a payload of weaponry that put an end to the reign of terror the Хаак thought would last forever within $SECTOR1$. $KILLER$, on behalf of the $GOVERNMENT1$, we salute you, and all your kind. You are a credit to your race. Long may your heroism live on in the memories of all those you have saved through your selfless actions.  </t>
 <t id="2020101">We have received notification that a Capital class Хаак Warship has been destroyed by $KILLER$ after an intense engagement in the heart of $SECTOR1$. While enemy units are still marked for elimination by sector forces, it is believed that the battle is being won, albeit slowly. Our prayers are with you, for all those currently in combat, or supporting those who are fighting to keep our frontiers safe, may you be homewards bound soon.  </t>
 <t id="2020102">With the conflict in $SECTOR1$ starting to abate, multiple Хаак units are confirmed to have been neutralised at this time. While $SECTOR1$ is still weapons free and will remain so as long as there are enemy vessels in the area, the main threats appear to have been eliminated. $KILLER$ is reported to have single handedly turned the tide of the battle by eliminating a Capital class warship.  $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols have confirmed they will continue to engage with all Хаак vessels in conjunction with the strong military presence. We hope to bring you news of further success in good time. </t>
 <t id="2030000">Хаак Ships Moving Towards $SECTOR2$</t>
 <t id="2030100">Reports are coming in that one of the Хаак Vessels, possibly an M1 or M2, previously reported to have jumped into $SECTOR1$ is now on a trajectory that will bring it into $SECTOR2$ within the next few mizuras. No jump signatures have been detected at this time and it is believed the vessel is working on thrust vectoring only. All combat craft in $SECTOR2$ please remain on high alert. All non essential craft, please evacuate with immediate effect. </t>
 <t id="2030101">The battle with the Хаак in $SECTOR1$, while not yet over, has progressed to an even more deadly phase. It appears that several craft are now setting course for $SECTOR2$. While many of these craft are damaged, they are still to be classed as a high-level threat by all vessels in the target sector. We ask all civilian craft to evacuate immediately. Do NOT use the jumpgate connecting to $SECTOR1$. Neither $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols or military units will be able to guarantee your safety. </t>
 <t id="2030102">Despite a large number of Хаак vessels having been destroyed, the threat posed by the swarm has not been reduced. Having engaged with $SECTOR1$ Patrols and military craft, the Хаак are now vectoring at full thrust for $SECTOR2$. Combat craft have been scrambled from trade stations, with defence forces preparing for the second phase of what may well turn out to be a very bloody battle. For the sake of our own, we hope the war that now rages on two fronts comes to a swift conclusion. </t>

 <t id="10200">&quot;I can't believe this is happening, I had a good job there, some place that atleast offered me some stability. Now? Now I don't know what I'll do,&quot; said one dejected worker who had just arrived from station transit.</t>
 <t id="10201">&quot;It's crazy, one minute the station's there, the next it's not. I'm just glad I wasn't there when this all happened.&quot; said one slightly bemused character we caught munching on a bofu-burger in the local trade station's canteen.</t>
 <t id="10202">A station manager situated in the same sector offered us a short comment, still clearly concerned with the unfolding situation. &quot;I don't know what to say, - it's not good that things like this happen, not in this age, where we're supposed to have conquered so much that is out there.&quot;</t>
 <t id="10203">One worker, evidently still upset by the whole scenario, offered us these words, &quot;there was no warning, nothing untoward that would have said to us, your days here are numbered. This is what frightens us the most, that we didn't know, and that something like this could happen again, anywhere.&quot;</t>
 <t id="10204">&quot;It's terrible. I had friends on that station, they were all doing so well. But now, now all I have are memories.&quot; - words spoken with great pain by a nearby station worker who is still coming to terms with the loss of such nearby neighbours.</t>
 <t id="10205">When questioned by our reporter, one worried onlooker ventured a few words of disbelief. &quot;It's crazy! I mean how could such a thing be allowed to happen? It's not like we come here to live on the edge, - I thought this sector was safe!&quot;</t>
 <t id="10206">&quot;I don't think I would have expected something like this to happen in our sector, - I thought we had the best of everything here! Apparently not.&quot; These words from yet another disgruntled worker, now looking for an alternate means of employment.</t>
 <t id="10207">&quot;All this time, and I never knew. It makes me wonder how close we are to other things that do us no good.&quot; These words from a concerned station worker who chose to share with us her concerns for the future.</t>
 <t id="10208">We managed to grab a few words from a Senator handling affairs for the sector before he boarded a shuttle for the planet surface. &quot;It's frightening to know that this happened right under the noses of sector authority. I mean what were they doing? Playing Triskele blindfolded while smoking space-weed? They should be out there patrolling, not sitting on their asses getting fat on bofu burgers. It's an outrage!&quot;</t>
 <t id="10209">One worker we managed to interview was clearly unhappy at the events, &quot;It would have been nice for us to be kept more informed than we have been. How can we plan our lives with such chaos? And to think that people are still trying to find out what has happened to their loved ones. It's terrible.&quot;</t>
 <t id="10210">One worker, struggling to come to terms with recent events, offered us these words, &quot;there isn't much we can do. Life has to go on I guess, but seeing so many lost in such a way does very little for my confidence in this sector. I'm not sure if I'll be here myself next mazura. Maybe it's time to cut my ties and make a new start.&quot;</t>
 <t id="10211">&quot;I'm shocked, - it's not something I've really thought about much until now, I mean, what if I'd been there when this had all happened?&quot; These thoughts from the partner of a worker who had recently departed the affected area. &quot;I'm not sure what we'll do now, but wherever we go, we'll be thinking of this, of what happened here. It's difficult not to.&quot;</t>
 <t id="10212">&quot;It's like something out of a dream, I never thought that something like this would ever happen here. Not here, amongst the places and people that you've grown up with. I don't know what to say.&quot; Little else could be gleaned from this worker who was evidently still in shock from the events that have taken this sector by storm.</t>
 <t id="10213">&quot;It's so sad to see things like this happen. I guess every sector has its fair share of joy and pain, but this is something else altogether. I'd like to think that this is the last time I ever have to witness such an event.&quot; These words from a worker who had recently been transferred from the affected area.</t>
 <t id="10214">&quot;I really hope they find out what happened. It's terrible that this happened so close to here. It's the worst I've heard from this sector in a long while.&quot; These words from a greatly concerned station manager who was now considering her own future. &quot;How can anyone promise us that such a thing won't happen again?&quot;</t>
 <t id="10215">&quot;It's sad to see things like this happen. I know every sector has good times and bad, but it still makes me wonder why these things always seem to happen here. I know we'll get over this in time, but right now, I'm just trying to make it through the here and now. That's always the toughest part.&quot; These words from a worker who was still trying to come to terms with the events that have unfolded here before our eyes.</t>
 <t id="10300">It may be some time before the sector comes to terms with the loss of this station. Until then, we wait and hope. To those who have been affected by these events, we offer our heartfelt thoughts. Further updates will be made throughout the coming mazura.</t>
 <t id="10301">Whether or not we will see the return of $STATION$, or some alternative to the services it once provided, only time will tell.</t>
 <t id="10302">There is little to say whether another venture will replace the station which has been lost, all we know is that time moves on, and with it the fortunes of those around us. Stay tuned to this data stream for more updates.</t>
 <t id="10303">There is very little that we can offer to alleviate the fears of those around us, save that those who have the power to do so, are investigating far and wide to confirm the cause for such sudden and immediate loss.</t>
 <t id="10304">There is no word yet as to whether the sector authority involved plans to replace the station with immediate effect, or allow the area to remain available for freelance venturers to try their hand.</t>
 <t id="10305">There is no word as of yet as to further action being taken by sector authority. It may be some time before we are able to come to the root cause of these happenings.</t>
 <t id="10306">With such events still giving authorities great cause for concern, there is little we can yet offer our readers save for words of comfort and confirmation that everything that can be done, is being done, for those affected.</t>
 <t id="10307">There may yet be further developments in this matter, until then, we can do nothing more than ensure that when the news breaks, we are close enough to bring you events as they unfold.</t>
 <t id="10308">Whether the cause of this event is natural or unnatural, you can be assured that in time the root of the mystery will be unearthed. Until then, we can speculate and ponder, however none of this will take the place of the cold hard facts we will of course provide you as they come through to us. Patch into this data stream for further updates.</t>
 <t id="10309">There is no confirmation yet from authorities as to whether these events are likely to continue, all we know is that there are a great many who have been affected. To these people, we offer our thoughts and best wishes. Stay linked to this data stream for further updates.</t>
 <t id="10310">Few have been able to do more than speculate as to the outcome of this situation. Given the number of people affected, this sector may well have worse to come in terms of the backlash from such an event. We will of course keep you updated as to the current situation.</t>
 <t id="10311">Despite our best efforts, there has been little official word from sector authority save that everything possible is being done to ensure that those affected are kept informed. We will of course bring you the news as it breaks. Stay tuned to this data-stream to receive the latest from our regular newscast team.</t>
 <t id="10312">Our reporters await further word from sector authority, as to when such information will come, no one knows. Until then, we will remain on alert and offer our sympathies to those affected by the situation that is still far from over at this time.</t>
 <t id="10313">We have little else to add to this story at this time, save that perhaps there may be further confirmation from sector authority as to what action will be taken in light of the number of people who have been affected by this event. Stay linked to this data stream for further updates.</t>
 <t id="10314">We wish to offer our sympathies to those affected by the events in this broadcast. Our thoughts are with the many families within this sector, and others, who are without their loved ones tonight. Further updates as we receive them will be made on this data stream.</t>
 <t id="10315">Sector authorities have chosen to withhold further updates until a more appropriate time. With events still very much in flux, there can be little of any substance offered at this time, save that our thoughts are with those affected by these events.

 <t id="3010014">A Stones Throw From Oblivion</t>
 <t id="3010015">End Of An Era For Station Owner</t>
 <t id="3010100">Following what may possibly be one of the worst environmental failures in $GOVERNMENT1$ history, there has been little choice but to completely dismantle and dispose of the $STATION$ within $SECTOR$. With immense quantities of production material having leaked into both the station air supply and life support systems, there has been no alternative but to initiate a full removal procedure. It is unclear whether the materials involved were hazardous enough to warrant such action, but authorities chose not to take any chances, fearing that loss of life at any level would result in the sector suffering further loss of confidence and trade opportunities.</t>
 <t id="3010101">After several jazuras, the owners of the $STATION$ operating in $SECTOR$ finally decided to take desperate measures in an attempt to locate several missing Argnu, who, in their search for somewhat better pastures, broke free and decided to roam far beyond the confines of the cargo bay they were held within. Working on sound alone, and the faint smell of waste gas emanating from the small but vociferous herd, station workers managed to locate all Argnu. Damage to station plating and structure was so widespread that the only course of action was a complete rebuild.</t>
 <t id="3010102">After many successful generations of trade in $SECTOR$, the inevitable stench of greed has wrapped its hands around the owners of the $STATION$. The ruthless Теладі tycoon Oluminogos Yasullios Moiyen III has once again forced another station to shut down and cease trading, all in the name of ever greater profits and fewer competitors. With a monetary offer said to range in the tens of millions, the owners of the station succumbed to the temptation of a quick profit and sold out. Within mizuras, station tugs and deconstructors arrived in-sector to engage in the process of dismantling.</t>
 <t id="3010103">Fears are growing for the safety of a family in $SECTOR$ who apparently left their $STATION$ after dismissing all employees and halting production. More disturbing is that the factory was placed in self-destruct mode, - or worse, was deliberately destroyed by other forces. Authorities continue to question those in their employment, as well as reviewing all data transmissions that were initiated within the last few jazuras. Given that this is now one of many occurrences of the same type of incident, it appears that there is something more sinister afoot than just the decision to cut losses and leave.</t>
 <t id="3010104">In what appears to have been a freak event, a freighter in $SECTOR$ engaging its jump drive before clearing docking moorings at the $STATION$ has dragged the entire station into an Невідомий plane of existence. Whether the station is intact or destroyed, no one has yet been able to confirm anything other than the following ; on entry into the target sector, the freighter brought with it several pieces of now detached station hull plating. This in itself is a cause for great concern. Given that literally hundreds if not thousands of ships dock and undock with stations while trading, it seems strange that such an event has not occurred before. Rumours persist that the ship involved was carrying a drive that had either not been serviced correctly, or was running firmware that was unable to prevent jump sequences from initiating when in close proximity to a station.</t>
 <t id="3010105">In a move that many have seen as potentially one of the most despicable acts in recent commercial history, a station owner within $SECTOR$ has quite literally stolen the ground from under his partners feet. While there is still no confirmation on who the individual is, what we do know is that sometime within the last few mazuras, in the shadow of darkness, an entire $STATION$ was shut down, dismantled and relocated to a sector as of yet Невідомий. All workers were dismissed without any word of remuneration or settlement.</t>
 <t id="3010106">The failure of both primary and back-up gravity generators has led to the loss and removal of yet another station within $SECTOR$. With both station owners and the manufacturers of the generators now wrapped in a bitter legal dispute over compensation for lost profits, the $STATION$ has been removed for further inspection at the manufacturers request. Under normal circumstances, it is extremely rare for both sets of generators to simultaneously fail, which begs the question, was this sabotage in the hope of legal remuneration? Or something far more sinister?</t>
 <t id="3010107">Following the discovery of an illicit Pleasure Complex operation running within the very confines of a $STATION$, sector authorities at $SECTOR$ have chosen to take firm action by shutting down the facility completely, with a complete deconstruct and removal being initiated at the owners expense. Hoping that this may cause other owners with such plans to think again, we have yet to see if further operations of this kind are discovered. It strikes us as being somewhat strange that workers did not notice the presence of scantily clad pleasure-borgs smothered in nostrop oil. Whether they were in collusion with those involved, or simply getting free or cut-price services, we have no idea.</t>
 <t id="3010108">The sector of $SECTOR$ woke up today to a strange sight, - the apparent disappearance of yet another station, this time a $STATION$. The cause of the disappearance is still being reviewed, rumours are spreading of everything from a massive cloaking device, to theft by the Yaki who have recently been specialising in mobile stations.</t>
 <t id="3010109">Amongst the many genuine efforts to replace many of the ageing factories in $SECTOR$ with newer models, another station has been dismantled in an apparent confidence trick. A team of individuals recently boarded the $STATION$ disguised as sector management, then notified station owners that preparation for a new structure was being made to replace their station over the coming mazura. Shortly after, the station was shut down at speed and dismantled, with little in terms of replacement save for some space debris and leftover canisters. While genuine constructors are still wary of discussing all their details in public, it is clear that any new station replacement will be preceded with official paperwork and incorporate all the latest facilities known and loved by traders and workers alike. Should you receive anything less, contact sector authority immediately and lock down your facilities until they arrive.</t>
 <t id="3010110">The fear of contracting Аргон flu from migrant traders has done more than just affect profit margins. Due to the severity of this jazura's strain, more and more workers have chosen to work elsewhere. The end result of these choices has been that yet another station has been shut down and dismantled, in this case a $STATION$. Despite assurances of immunisation and protection from those passing through $SECTOR$, few have been swayed by such words.</t>
 <t id="3010111">A set of minor repairs that should have taken no more than a few mizuras of down-time for the $STATION$ in $SECTOR$ have resulted in the complete destruction of the facility. The station owner, as of yet at large, decided in his infinite wisdom, that undertaking the repairs himself, instead of hiring certified technicians, was the best thing to do. Shortly after this decision, workers were seen fleeing the station in shuttles as the entire facility lost power and life support. Soon after this, structural integrity was lost, leaving sector authorities with no choice but to take the station apart before it fell to pieces.</t>
 <t id="3010112">In what may be the most astounding news this mazura, sector authorities have uncovered Yaki operations within the heart of a $STATION$ in $SECTOR$. Military forces cordoned off the area while the station was shut down and removed for further investigations at a more secure area. Hoping to gain further insight into the workings of this clandestine pirate faction, little was being left to chance here. Those employed at the station are currently undergoing interrogation to clarify whether workers were aware that some of their shift-mates were in fact Yaki.</t>
 <t id="3010113">A station owners final wish was marked today with his demise. In what appears to be a growing trend, the owner chose to be interred upon his $STATION$, which was then placed on an intercept course with the nearest sun. Now out of sight and scan range, it is expected that the station will burn up within the suns gravitational range in the next mazura. All workers have been transferred to other facilities within $SECTOR$ until further employment can be found. While few station managers consider this to be a wise use of resources, they are still reticent to argue with their employers final wishes, which very rarely can be overturned.</t>
 <t id="3010114">Juvenile delinquents are being blamed for the destruction of a $STATION$ in $SECTOR$. It is still unclear as to whether they all perished along with others in this tragedy. Deciding that throwing rocks into the gravity wells would be fun, they were somewhat surprised when the rocks gained momentum and made a sling-shot at incredible velocity back out into the inner hull of the station. Thinking this was little more than another level of excitement to be had in their lethal game of physics, they then proceeded to source the largest rock available from nearby ore freighters. According to witnesses who were in the process of departing when the incident occurred, several of the youths pushed the immense rock to the edge of the gantry. Seconds later, with the station hull pierced, few heard their screams as one of the group was sucked out into the void, while the others struggled to keep their blood from boiling in the sudden vacuum. Station safety protocols not being correctly set for internal breach damage, failed to initiate lockdown, leaving the entire station without air supply. The facility has been removed and is the focus of what is now a crime scene.</t>
 <t id="3010115">After a lifetimes worth of trading in $SECTOR$, the owner of $STATION$ has chosen to close shop for the final time this mazura. With no apparent heirs, and no confirmed buyers, the station has been dismantled and sold to scrap-merchants for recycling. Our owner looked somewhat forlorn as he departed what had been his home for so long, &quot;so many memories have been had here, I've seen times or war, times of peace, the good and bad of all races, but in the end, all we have are our memories.&quot; We could respond with little more than sympathy to such honesty.</t>

 <t id="510">You are now approaching your complex. It produces microchips that can be sold.</t>
 <t id="511">Other traders will dock here and buy them.</t>
 <t id="512">You can also take them and sell them yourself, or even command your transporter to sell them automatically.</t>
 <t id="513">To do so, give your transporter the command to sell wares and select microchips.</t>
 <t id="514">Your complex will need silicon wafers to continue producing. They can be found in asteroids.</t>
 <t id="515">Use your transporter to mine the asteroids or build a silicon mine on an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="516">A mine can be bought in a shipyard, but you have to hire a TL like a Mammoth or a Orca to transport your station.</t>
 <t id="517">A mine can be bought in a shipyard, but you have to hire a TL like a mammoth to transport your station.</t>
 <t id="520">You have just entered Королівський Вінець.</t>
 <t id="521">It's one of five sectors available in the demo.</t>
 <t id="522">The sector belongs to a race called the Boron.</t>
 <t id="523">In X³ there are several different races. They have some unique technology such as different ships.</t>
 <t id="524">Fly to a dock to check out the offered wares there or have a look at the different ships the Boron use.</t>
 <t id="530">You are now sitting in your transporter.</t>
 <t id="531">It has a large cargo space but weak weapons.</t>
 <t id="532">You can use it to transport cargo from one station to another.</t>
 <t id="533">It also has all the equipment needed for mobile mining.</t>
 <t id="534">You can use the mining laser to shoot an asteroid to smaller peaces.</t>
 <t id="535">Those peaces can also be crushed with normal lasers.</t>
 <t id="536">Once the peaces are small enough, you can open your cargo bay and collect them by flying towards them.</t>
 <t id="537">You can give your ships orders. The transporter could be used to sell wares for you.</t>
 <t id="538">That only works if you're not sitting in it, and you have to give the ship a homebase first.</t>
 <t id="539">You can set the homebase in the command menu of your transporter while not sitting in it.</t>
 <t id="540">There are several stations in each sector.</t>
 <t id="541">The main sectors contain special stations with a huge variety of wares that you can buy.</t>
 <t id="542">This is a shipyard. You can buy ships and stations here. While it's easy to buy ships, you'll need a TL to buy a station.</t>
 <t id="543">You can search for a Mammoth or an Orca and contact its captain, then hire him and tell him to dock at the shipyard.</t>
 <t id="544">That way you can buy a station and let the TL take it to its destination for you.</t>
 <t id="545">Here you can see an equipment dock. That's the place to go if you need better lasers or shields.</t>
 <t id="546">You can also buy different upgrades for your ships there.</t>
 <t id="547">The trading station trades a lot of different goods like food or minerals.</t>
 <t id="548">If you ever look for something or want to sell anything, try it there.</t>
 <t id="550">You have just entered your fighter.</t>
 <t id="551">As already mentioned, it's much stronger than your scout.</t>
 <t id="552">It can still be upgraded with one more shield and more weapons.</t>
 <t id="553">A good choice would be to buy a mass driver with corresponding ammunition.</t>
 <t id="554">To afford that you need to earn money or you could sell your scout.</t>
 <t id="555">To do so, order it to dock at the shipyard. Then trade with the station using the menu or dock there.</t>
 <t id="556">You could also keep it and let it protect you. Then it will fight the attacking Хаак.</t>
 <t id="557">Use the protect me command if you want to.</t>
 <t id="901">Your small fighter</t>
 <t id="902">Your heavy fighter</t>
 <t id="903">Your transporter</t>
 <t id="904">Your station complex</t>

We require up to date system information in relation to factories, asteroids and hazards in $TARGETSEC$ and we are asking for interested pilots as our current pilot is missing. The available reward is  $REWARD_STATION$ cr for each station and $REWARD_ASTEROID$ cr for each asteroid located and identified. Additional credits will be paid of $REWARD_ASTEROID_S$ cr if mineral yield data is provided. Credits will be paid for other objects located, for example gates.\n\n If you've worked for us before, you'll know you have to target the objects to obtain the reward. Not all data about the object is collected when you just fly through the sector as your scanner requires focus to obtain higher quality information.

Routine security and background checks on auction participants have revealed that one of the bidders had connections to the vendor of the sector and was apparently bidding with the aim of artificially inflating the final sale price. As a result of this discovery, the auction has been declared null and void. The authorities have stated that despite the fraud, sale of the sector should go ahead in order to help the vendor's creditors. A new round of bidding will therefore begin shortly, this time with bids only being accepted from bidders whose credentials have already been checked.[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="4">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Excellent! I see you have some sense in that strange skull of yours. I have engaged both AI Defence Borgs and a protectorate officer close to your ship.

 <t id="5">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Such a shame that you have chosen to decline my offer. A bad choice if I may say.

 <t id="1001">Wield the developing power of your fledgling fleet and face the X Universe head on. You are well equipped for your journey, but there may be advantages to doing it the hard way...</t>
 <t id="1002">Conquer a harsh and unforgiving universe with the pure power of your will. Struggles will present themselves at every turn. Even your enemies loathe you with an unusual intensity.</t>
 <t id="1003">You have the tools and the passion to discover the riches of the myriad worlds around you. Follow your lifelong dreams and uncover the mysteries of the X Universe.</t>

<page id="302600" title="Gametips" descr="Ingame tips for the player that are shown once an action is performed for the first time." voice="0">
 <t id="1">Welcome to the Interactive Assistance System. This feature of your ship computer will automatically present information about common tasks you may wish to perform, based on your current location and situation. You can access all information in one location by choosing Options, then All Tips from your ship menu. Data will be streamed to your onboard computer should you encounter species or items requiring further information essential to your survival. If at any time you wish to disable this data-stream, you may do so by changing from Beginner to Veteran in the Options menu of your ship interface.</t>
 <t id="2">You have acquired your first weapon system. While in combat, you can configure up to four weapons profiles to control which weapons are loaded and active. Next to each weapon slot indicator on your HUD is a selector which you can use to activate or deactivate the given weapon slot in each weapons profile. You can switch profiles at any time by selecting the profile number icon on the HUD, or via a hotkey. Due to the complexity of installing weapons systems, you will only be able to change the types of weapons loaded on your ship when you are docked, at which time you can install and remove weapons via the Weapons menu.</t>
 <t id="3">You can observe other ships and stations in your sector via the monitor window in the upper right corner of your display. The monitor in the upper left will display a view of your current target. You can monitor your target by opening the Identification menu \(press [VK_IDENTIFY]\) and selecting the Monitor option.</t>
 <t id="4">Your ship's data interface can be controlled with the mouse. To activate the mouse cursor, press [VK_MOUSETOGGLE]. You can fully customise your interface controls by selecting the Controls item from the Options menu.</t>
 <t id="5">Most common functions of your ship interface can be accessed directly with the quick-access icon bar on the right side of your display. Select the up arrow to open the icon bar. You can also access many common functions with configurable hotkeys. These keys can be customised by selecting the Controls item from the Options menu.</t>
 <t id="6">Around the edges of your display you will see targeting icons for all contacts your scanners have picked up. Select these icons to target the object and receive additional options for interacting with the object. Your HUD will automatically display indicators of the target's status and current position.</t>
 <t id="7">Different ships are capable of deploying different missiles. While all ships can carry missiles as cargo \(provided they have sufficient space\), many missile systems are only supported by certain ships. You can review your ship's missile capabilities specification in the Weapons screen as well as the Ship Details screen. When docked, your ship's information is accessible through the Personal area of the main menu. While flying in space, this information is directly available through the Current Ship area.</t>
 <t id="8">This ship has multiple weapons turrets. You can manually control these turrets by pressing [VK_COCKPITVIEW] to cycle through them, or configure them to automatically respond to threats via the Orders screen for your ship.</t>
 <t id="9">The dregs of the underworld, criminal fringe, and lawless scum of the universe gather in these pirate bases to trade in illegal goods and arrange for various shady activities. Regardless of your reasons for being here, your very presence is likely to earn you a death mark from someone. Dealing with the pirate clans can be immensely profitable, but don't be surprised to find a bomb planted in your cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="11">You are in close proximity to a trade ship. With a special Freight Scanner upgrade, you can check the contents of other ships and their cargo bays. Note that while you can scan ships freely, most governments require that you have a special Police License to use a Freight Scanner. Scanning without a license can have serious consequences.</t>
 <t id="12">With appropriate policing licenses, you can actively engage in combat with confirmed enemies, as well as intercept and neutralise smugglers without casting any undue suspicion on yourself in the process. Many local governments offer nominal bounties for terminating invaders and criminals, so skilled vigilantes can earn a substantial living by holding security licenses. The license also allows you to use a Freight Scanner device to locate criminals and smugglers.</t>
 <t id="13">You have locked on to a civilian ship. These vessels comprise the bulk of the space-faring population, and are the lifeblood of the economy. Civilian transports are primarily menial in nature, and pose no particular threat.</t>
 <t id="14">Sector police vessels primarily work to maintain the peace within their space, as well as ensure ships in transit through the sector are not carrying illegal cargo. Enemies and criminals are likely to be dealt with very harshly by the local security forces.</t>
 <t id="15">You can eject from your ship at any time with the Ejection hotkey \([VK_EJECT]\). You can also use this hotkey to re-enter a ship you own while you are in your spacesuit. An option to enter your own ships will be available in the Identification menu when you are close enough to the ship.</t>
 <t id="16">This ship is currently not claimed by any owner. To take possession of this ship, eject from your ship and approach it in your spacesuit. When you are close enough to the ship, an option to enter it will become available in the Identification menu.</t>
 <t id="17">You have received a warning from your Ship A.I. At your current position, your ship computer is unable to lock down a safe trajectory along which to fly. Please take manual control and move your ship to a location that will allow vector recalculations to be completed successfully.</t>
 <t id="18">You will fly a race now. Fly to the marked start position and wait there for the start. After the start, follow the targetted waypoint objects until you reach the finish line first. You will lose race if you leave the sector or if you are last and more than 30 seconds behind the racer in front of you. </t>
 <t id="19">Saya has used a Jump Scanner to find out where Marani jumped to. The coordinates have been uploaded to your boardcomputer. When you open your jumpdrive menu with [VK_JUMPDRIVE], you will have the option to choose these coordinates directly or select another location from the galaxy map.</t>
 <t id="20">Once you have hired a TL class ship and loaded your station on board, you will need to give it further instructions. To do this, go to the station menu and select the ship from the list of landed ships. You can then give the Captain your orders.</t>
 <t id="21">The laser target computer enables you to target your enemy more effectively. It provides two features to help you in combat. It allows your ship computer to automatically adjust the laser direction by a few degrees to improve accuracy, and it also provides you with a lead firing indicator to help you aim in the right direction. Press [VK_LASERTARGETMODE] or click the icon to the left of the lasergroups to toggle between the available target modes.</t>
 <t id="22">You are able to mine precious metals and minerals from asteroids, once they have been broken up into small enough pieces. After the asteroid has been fragmented, - either by mining laser or Hornet missile, you will then need to break it up further using laser weaponry. Eventually you will be able to source rocks that are small enough to be refined by your Ore Collector, which you must have installed. You will notice them by their differing colour. Be aware that these small rocks will vaporise if fired upon. Open your freight bay and collect the rock as you would do standard cargo cannisters to initiate pick-up. Please be aware that there is currently only one miner ship available that is able to handle a front-mounted mobile drilling system. It is up to you to source locations for this vessel's purchase or acquisition.</t>
 <t id="101">If you wish to buy a station at this shipyard, you will need to engage the services of a TL class ship. This vessel will dock with the shipyard on your behalf and load all material required for installation. You will be able to issue commands to the TL after your purchase, allowing you to specify which sector and in what physical location your station is to be unloaded. While hired, the TL will make a charge for every sector you travel through.</t>
 <t id="102">Shipyards are the prime location for purchasing, repairing, and selling ships. Ships of many different classes and variants are produced in shipyards throughout the universe. Smaller ships such as the M5 class provide fast but lightly armed scout ships. TS freighters are excellent platforms for carrying trade cargoes. Many ships are available in variants that improve specific aspects of the ship's performance, such as shielding power or cargo capacity. Heavily customized ships are rare, however, and thus very valuable.</t>
 <t id="103">You have targeted another object in your local vicinity. You can identify this target by pressing [VK_IDENTIFY]. The Target Identification menu will allow you to access additional details about your target and provides options for interacting with your target.</t>
 <t id="104">Once you have engaged the services of a TL class vessel, you can either dock at the shipyard and interact with the station's trade interface directly, or you can trade remotely providing you have the necessary trade software. Either way, you will need to wait until the TL has docked and confirmed it has authorisation to trade on your behalf before you can begin to make purchases. </t>
 <t id="105">Now that you have deployed your first station, it is time for you to choose various options that will affect both your profit, as well as the level of business and turn-over you achieve. Setting your selling price high might scare off potential buyers, but if it is too low you may lose money on your products. Similarly, be sure to buy your resources for reasonable prices to optimise your profit margin. Here you can also control how many sectors away ships assigned to this station will fly to buy and sell goods, via the Jumps setting. Experiment with these parameters and be prepared to adjust them in response to changes in the local economy.</t>
 <t id="106">Any ships that you own or purchase can be assigned to your stations to buy and sell goods. To assign a ship to your station, open the Orders menu for the ship, and set the ship's Home Base to this station. You will then be able to issue Trade orders to the ship. All worker ships will follow the settings you have assigned to your station, including price and maximum travel range.</t>
 <t id="107">You now are in possession of multiple ships. While you are manually piloting one of your ships, you can use your others to work for you by issuing them orders. Target one of your own ships and select Orders from the Identification menu. You can change the ship you are currently flying by docking at a station, ejecting from your ship and spacewalking, or with a special teleporter device that is available at certain locations.</t>
 <t id="108">Equipment docks specialise in upgrades for ships. Command Software upgrades offer access to additional orders that can be issued to ships. Many different devices are available which can extend the usefulness of your ships. Additionally, you can upgrade the main engines and steering systems of your ships to improve speed and handling. Special subspace compression upgrades also allow you to expand the cargo capacity of certain ships.</t>
 <t id="109">Scanners operate on a variety of power levels, from close-range to long-range sector-wide overviews. More powerful scanners can be installed on your ship to provide a better view of the sector, provided that your ship is capable of handling the larger scanner equipment.</t>
 <t id="110">The Universe Map provides a visual display of the territory that has been recorded in your ship's computer database. It also provides you with the ability to monitor remote locations in real-time. Information from any ships, stations, or monitoring satellites you own in a sector will automatically be uploaded to your ship's computer on a regular basis, and displayed via the Universe Map.</t>
 <t id="111">Your ship has the ability to dock and interact with various stations. You can allow your AI subsystems to do the work for you with an auto dock \(see your operations manual for the interface commands\) or you can request docking rights manually by opening a communications channel to the station. Use the docking lights and ship speed indicators as a guide on your approach.</t>
 <t id="112">You will usually find gates situated at the North, East, West, and South points of a sector. Not all sectors will make use of all four jump points. Layout is dependent on your location in the universe. Be aware that on occasion you will encounter gates that are neither marked nor freely known of within the local sector traffic. An alternative means of travel is the jumpdrive device, for which you will need the minimum of an M4 class vessel and an energy source. It is commonly available from the Гонер Temple in Південно-Західна Хмарна База. </t>
 <t id="113">Freight comes in a variety of standardised container sizes, known by their TC class: Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. Different ships are outfitted to handle different sized containers. You can view the maximum container size handled by your ship and the total cargo capacity in your Ship Details screen. When docked, your ship's information is accessible through the Personal area of the main menu. While flying in space, this information is directly available through the Current Ship area.</t>
 <t id="114">This area is your ship's command and control interface. Here you can issue and manage orders for your ships and stations. Purchasing software upgrades and installing other technology may update the command software with additional orders and options.</t>
 <t id="115">Пояс Руди is a particularly dense asteroid field. Here many entrepreneurs have earned a fortune through mining. There are a variety of ways you can engage in mining, from purchasing an ore or silicon mining facility at a shipyard, to using mobile drilling apparatus mounted on specially built ships. At close range, a mining rig will pummel an asteroid until it shatters, allowing you to scoop up the debris of ore or silicon into your cargo bay. Special mineral scanning upgrades are also available which can help locate the richest and most profitable deposits.</t>
 <t id="116">You have entered a sector that is claimed by the Ксенон. The Ксенон have been the scourge and mortal enemy of the known universe since time immemorial. With no single intelligence, they work purely on directives issued from a distributed AI of Невідомий origin. They do not communicate openly and will not listen to reason. Open combat with the Ксенон is usually considered unwise.</t>
 <t id="117">Your ship scanners have reported the presence of a hostile vessel nearby. The targeting system can be placed into threat-prioritisation mode by pressing [VK_NEXTENEMY]. In this mode, the targeting computer will automatically select an enemy target. Should the target lock be lost for any reason, a new target will automatically be selected.</t>
 <t id="118">A message has been transmitted to you and received by your ship computer. You can access the message by opening the Pilot menu and selecting the icon for Incoming Message.</t>
 <t id="119">Once docked at a station, you have the option to browse through and access data within the online BBS, or Bulletin Board System. Here you will find news, messages, and job opportunities. You may also come across information vendors offering you maps and other technical data. </t>
 <t id="120">You have purchased a weapon that requires a specific form of ammunition. It does not feed directly from your ship's energy banks, but instead draws from a supplemental ammunition supply stored in your ship's weapons bay. You can purchase ammunition for such weaponry from various suppliers, although it is likely to be cheapest directly from the manufacturer.</t>
 <t id="121">Here you can save and restore your status as you see fit. Saving is available free of charge when docked at any station. In addition, private insurance firms offer salvage policies that will allow you to save your status at any point you wish. Should you encounter any situation that leads to the destruction of your ship or property, and should your body be medically viable for restoration, you will be returned to the status of your last salvage point.</t>
 <t id="122">You have locked on to a cargo container. Containers hold a variety of items and are the standard method by which goods are stored for transit. Dependent on the size of the container and your available cargo space, you may be able to pick this container up by opening your cargo bay \(press [VK_OPENBAYDOOR]\) and guiding your ship to the location of the container. Be warned that while your cargo bay is open, your shields are down and your ship will be vulnerable.</t>
 <t id="123">Should you accidentally damage or destroy a ship to which you had no hostile intentions, you can contact local sector police or military units to declare the incident, - allowing you to be exonerated. Contacting a capital-class military vessel will allow all ships owned by that vessel in the sector to have their friend or foe status reset. This does not include any ships that are docked within the vessel itself. Smaller ships will of course also accept your amnesty. </t>
 <t id="301">WARNING\n\nThe next wave will attack in 30 minutes. You've still got time to prepare yourself. The next warning will be sent 10 minutes before the attack begins.</t>
 <t id="302">WARNING\n\nThe next wave will attack in 10 minutes. You should check your weapons and other fighting equipment. If you are flying a transporter you should consider transporting into a fighter ship. A last warning will be sent 1 minute before the attack begins.</t>

 <t id="703">You show little skill in commerce! How could one such as you fail?</t>

 <t id="731">We have little left to lose and much to gain should you choose to accelerate.</t>
 <t id="732">There may be greater commerce elsewhere, but we may not survive to profit from it, should you maintain this speed.</t>
 <t id="733">Our journey towards greater profits has ended abruptly. Perhaps this course is incorrect.</t>
 <t id="740">Please transmit all current price data. Profits await us all!</t>
 <t id="741">This one is not for you! This is marked for Теладі Corporations!</t>
 <t id="742">We have little else other than a dream of great fortune. Please help us, we ask for no more than a few of your valuable credits!</t>

<page id="301810" title="Beginner Tutorial 0" descr="Quick Menu introduction (spoken by Instructor)" voice="yes">
 <t id="1">Welcome to the Аргон Federation Space Academy, my name is Uri Seldom and I will be here to guide you through the key features of the interface for your ship computer. You may quit this tutorial at any time by pressing Shift-Q on your ships data interface.</t>
 <t id="2">You are currently sitting in an M5 Аргон Discoverer. This is a small scout-class vessel, however the menu structure will remain the same regardless of which ship you pilot. This standardisation was introduced to prevent confusion not only for the different pilots but different races amongst the known universe.</t>
 <t id="3">Now, let's start off by showing you how to access you primary ship menu.</t>
 <t id="4">Press the Enter key on your ships Data Interface.</t>
 <t id="5">Good. You will now see an Information Panel appear, labelled Main Menu, along which you will see five icons, Pilot, Current Ship, Navigation, Target and Options.</t>
 <t id="6">You will notice that the icon for Navigation is slowly pulsing. This indicates that Navigation is currently your selected option. You can use your right or left arrow keys, or activate your ships Mobile Online Universal Sector Engagement device, or M.O.U.S.E to select the Navigation icon now.</t>
 <t id="7">Excellent, you have selected the Navigation Menu, which has now been opened to show you two additional options, Universe Map and Sector Map. The Universe Map will provide you with a clear idea of where you are, in relation to those sectors you have visited, or purchased maps for. This will often help you plan out flight routes or trading strategies.</t>
 <t id="8">Select the Universe Map option now. You will immediately see your sector represented by a circle enclosed by a square. Pressing Enter again will show you the same view as the Sector Map, allowing you to view all scanned ships, stations and other objects in range.</t>
 <t id="9">Pressing Esc on your ship data interface will bring you back one level, pressing it again will do the same. Once you have pressed Esc twice you will now be at the main menu. You can also use the down arrow to go back to the previous menu, this serves as an alternative to the Esc key.</t>
 <t id="10">You can access all other menus using the same commands, either with your M.O.U.S.E or by ship data interface.</t>
 <t id="11">On the main menu you will see four other menu options: Pilot, Current Ship, Target and Options. Opening the Pilot menu will enable to access all data and records that reference your personal status, from the time you have been flying, to how many credits you have, as well as the property you own. You will also be able to initiate an emergency eject from this menu using the Eject option. \(This will disengage your ships automatic safety mechanisms and allow you to break through the cockpit. Please ensure you are wearing your spacesuit before engaging Eject.\)</t>
 <t id="12">Now let's look at the Current Ship Menu, pressing Enter or using your M.O.U.S.E to select it with one left click will allow you to view all data for your current ship. This includes information such as your ship equipment, any cargo it is carrying, its weaponry and shield specification, as well as what class or capacity of cargo you are able to carry.</t>
 <t id="13">The submenu for your Current Ship will offer you four further options. Details will provide you with an in-depth look at your ship specification. The Weapons menu will show you which lasers and missiles are currently loaded into your mounts. The Orders menu will give you the option to command your ship using a variety of options and choices. And finally the freight menu will give you a rundown of what your ship is currently holding. On this menu you will also have the option to choose to eject any items you no longer wish to carry. To do so simply use the arrow keys to highlight the item, then select eject, and then specify how many of the item you wish to eject using either your numeric pad, or the arrow keys.</t>
 <t id="14">Now press ESC and then choose 'Target' from the Main Menu.</t>
 <t id="15">The Target menu offers you the chance to view detailed information about the ship or object you have locked on using your ships heads-up display system. This will include ship class, name, shields and weaponry, as well as other information that you are privileged to access.</t>
 <t id="16">Finally, the &quot;Options&quot; menu will allow you to configure the behaviour of the universe you are in. These items are explained in detail in your Ship Computer interface manual. Under the game menu you will also be able to access options to engage salvage insurance to save or load prior points in your progress. You will also be able to pause your current status, as well as depart from the X universe.</t>
 <t id="17">You have now seen the basic concepts and levels of information that you can obtain from your ships menu interface. We hope you will have an enjoyable flight.</t>

 <t id="100">You can look up ALL keys for various types of controllers in your printed manual or the most common ones from the HELP menu which opens up by pressing the H key. -- To familiarize yourself with the controls, a number of Kessler Rings have been activated. Your task is to pass all rings. Rings that you have not passed yet are marked with a green light. -- You control the ship steering with the &quot;turn ship&quot; and &quot;roll ship&quot;-keys as well as a wide set of (ADDED)&quot;strafe&quot; and(/ADDED) &quot;speed control&quot; keys. Look them up in the manual now and learn how to manoeuver your ship through the rings. </t>
 <t id="102">You see the ship computer's main menu. Now leave the menu by pressing the &quot;back&quot; or the &quot;Close menu&quot; key.</t>
 <t id="130">Very well done. You have successfully collected a container which is now in your ship's freight bay. Now it's time for a space walk. -- A new ship has arrived near your location and waits to be boarded by you. Move in closer to the new ship, then leave your cockpit via &quot;eject pilot from ship&quot; in the ship menu.</t>

 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Аргон federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom. In this simulation level we will concentrate on menu usage. I will also explain how to trade with stations and to have some fun you will be allowed to destroy a couple of ships using missiles. You can again quit this session at any time.</t>
 <t id="3">Very good! You are now docked to the station.</t>
 <t id="15">From the &quot;Freight Bay&quot;-menu you get an overview of wares you have on board and what upgrades are currently installed in the ship. Goods can be ejected here. -- You have some unnecessary plankton loaded. Eject all of it now by first selecting it and then selecting the amount with the &quot;menu selection left/right&quot; keys. -- Then confirm your selection with the &quot;select&quot; key. Please select the appropriate menu option now.</t>
 <t id="21">When the targeting system has locked onto the station open the Sector Map again.</t>
 <t id="25">Ok, the station's docking mechanism is ready for your ship to land. Now approach very carefully, otherwise you will collide with the station.</t>
 <t id="61">Good! This time your defenceless opponent is an M3-class ship. When you open the infomenu for the target you see the ships' actual shield and hull strength. - Note that a ships hull can only be damaged once the shield level reaches zero. -- However any damage you inflict on a ship's hull is permanent and would require a repair service offered by all shipyards. - Damage done to the shield of a ship on the other hand is only temporary. It regains its power after a short time. -- The Dragonfly missile has a destruction power a little more than the current shield and strength of this ship. So, if you launch this missile towards the ship, it will not just reduce the shield to zero but even harm the ships hull already. To blow up the ship you need to destroy the ship hull completely! </t>

 <t id="5">Good. You can now observe what's going on behind your ship in monitor nr. 1. -- But a monitor is not just a nice display. You can even take over the control of any monitor with just one button. Press the &quot;activate next monitor&quot;-key now.</t>
 <t id="6">With this key you can cycle through the connected monitors. (CUT) Once the monitor is active your controls are all mapped to this view. -- In an active monitor, you can now again cycle through the available views as well. Press the &quot;next cockpit&quot;-key one time now to switch to main-cockpit view in monitor 1.</t>
 <t id="27">OK. The TL has now docked here. Dock at the station and bring up the stations menu.</t>

 <t id="50">Good work - the transporter will now move on - heading to the Solar Power Plant. We'll care about it later on. As you own a second transporter, use it to get Ore automatically. -- Command &quot;Transporter 2 of Forge&quot; to &quot;Buy ware...&quot; and then choose &quot;Ore&quot; and as destination factory the &quot;Ore Mine Alpha&quot;. -- This will make the ship fly to the specified station to get the resource but this time it will fly out only once.</t>
 <t id="52">Very well done! The transporter is on its way to get Ore for the Forge. -- Now we have to wait until &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at the Solar Power Plant. Meanwhile you could watch the transporter in a monitor...</t>
 <t id="60">&quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at the Power Plant! Now you will find the menu-item &quot;trade with station&quot; in its ship menu allowing you to load the needed Energy Cells into the ship. Buy 600 Energy Cells right now.</t>
 <t id="83">&quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at the Bakery. Please wait until the Cahoona Bakery has produced an amount of 100 Meatsteaks to load them into &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot;. By the way: You can look up the progress of the production in the station menu.</t>
 <t id="3210">Very good - the ships are about to start and execute their tasks! Since a transporter from the forge is supposed to buy ware automatically later on, please set the following two parameters of the Forge: credits to 35000 and buying price of Ore to maximum.</t>
 <t id="5210">Please wait until &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at the Solar Power Plant.</t>
 <t id="8210">Please wait until &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at your Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="10210">Please wait until &quot;Transporter 1 of Forge&quot; has landed at the Forge.</t>
