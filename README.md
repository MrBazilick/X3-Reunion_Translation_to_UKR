# X3-Reunion_Translation_to_UKR
  Fan text translation of legendary game by EGOSOFT to Ukrainian. I'm glad to receive all your feedback for this translation, if you notice some mistakes, or you think that something will be more suitable for this translation - don't mind to notify me)
I want to make this translation to rise awareness of this beautiful game and this beautiful X-Universe in my country, because, sadly, most of my friend never heard about such a game, and I want to fix this) So The first goal is to translate all text in game, and next step is make a voice translation, nut this will be much more difficult)
  So I have started from files **440001.xml** and **440002.xml** that stands for english version of the game, and I will use it as reference.
 To check this translation you need to:
  -Add two files **80001.xml** and **80002.xml** in: ..\X3 - Runion\t;
  -Change value to 8 in file **lang.dat** in ..\X3 - Runion; save the file and run the game.
